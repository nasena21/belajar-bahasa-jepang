Read material that is similar to what you want to output:
For expressing your opinion/moods: twitter, personal blogs
For instructions, essays, and analysis: read how-to guides/self-help books, essays, informational articles

Read what you are interested in. There's no need to force yourself to read stuff you don't care about.


Use twitter to tweet:
Read a lot of other people's tweets, simpler tweets and personal accounts are better. Try to find individuals or creators that interest you.
If you are too self-conscious when you tweet, you can write in a notepad or something.

Practice speaking alone or in your head:
Try saying out parts or a not-to-difficult line of thought. You should have a high enough JP level that you kind of get a feeling what is wrong. So you correct yourself until you have reasonably okay Japanese, even if you may not know the most natural way JP say it.
The biggest advantage of this is you can do it any time, it's pressure-free, and you have unlimited time to recall words and correct your speech.
If you are still getting stuck not being able to say what you want even with time, it may be one of the following:
Your subject matter is too complex or has too many words that you don't have in your passive vocab
You haven't gotten enough exposure to native materials in that area (for example, it can be hard to voice your opinions simply, if you've only read fiction and not twitter, because the common/useful phrases are different.
Your overall JP level is not high enough so you can't correct yourself well enough. #2 is more important and almost always you can succeed by immersing in similar native materials (this is how conversation-centric learners can get pretty good at talking, even though their overall knowledge is worse than someone who has read widely)

General Tips:
Try to imitate what you've seen, as much as possible don't construct your own forms.
Try to speak about relatively simple topics to start. Stuff like "I sure wanna go travelling" is nice basic output
Speaking areas are somewhat mutually exclusive: if you practice talking analytically, you can actually become okay at talking about concepts, but be unable to say basic things. The takeaway is, feel free to specialize in talking about what you want, but remember to practice essential stuff too.
Start by saying fragments, 0.5-3 sentence long bits, instead of trying to convey a whole conversation/opinion all at once.
There are going to be feelings/sentences that you just don't know the grammar to express, I recommend replacing it with something similar that you do know, even if it's not exactly the same. Or skip it. To get better at this, immerse in more native conversation.
Lastly, try to learn how to say things in the simplest way. Stiff/pompous language is not practical and is not what you want popping up in your head when you are trying to talk for real.

Internalizing Intent vs phrase
I'm sure all of you have experienced this. When you are intermediate level, you can have this time where you have all sorts of random JP phrases pop up in your head. This is cool and means that you've reached a milestone in your immersion journey.

However, from experience I've found this type of random output is not useful in practical situations. Even though you can remember phrases from what you've read you get stuck unable to think of the phrase you need. 

How you fix this problem is also the core of how you should be practicing output. Remember that simple phrase "I sure wanna go travelling" 「旅行に行きたいな…」? The point is to connect/associate that internal feeling of that with the phrase (or the feeling when you want to express that concept). That works especially well with phrases that express a feeling, but also works with objective phrases too.

Timeline:

I think after 3 months of outputting on twitter you will notice a big improvement. If you tweet for 1 year you should be somewhat comfortable on the stuff you normally talk about. The input from reading twitter is really important so don't slack on that too.

For paragraph writing, don't worry if your paragraphs are really wacky. Keep it simple, stick to stuff you've heard before, and immerse in more similar native materials. Eventually your paragraphs will look natural enough, as you have learned enough useful structures that you don't have to resort to your own contrived phrasing.

For paragraph writing, I think your output can become sane-looking within 2-3 years after you hit N1 level immersing. If you immerse in a lot of blogs/relevant material and practice a bit it can be as low as 1 year.

I’m still slow AF for writing and messaging, so don’t ask me how to become faster. Probably it’s being less of a perfectionist: just write stuff out, make mistakes, and get corrected later.
From there how you can go to the next level is use Japanese in order to do something with natives. The more different types of activities you do, the more proficient/adept you will become at doing stuff in JP.

General advice:
Conversations are good, especially with people who you share something in common with.
Practical conversation is really good (like sending emails, playing a game together, interacting on twitter)
Anytime you have to use Japanese for practical purposes (hobby, reading how to do something) is really good for internalization.
Being in a situation where you a forced to use Japanese is really good (prep helps too)
