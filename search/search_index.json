There's no need to force yourself to read stuff you don't care about.</p> <p>Use twitter to tweet: Read a lot of other people's tweets, simpler tweets and personal accounts are better. Try to find individuals or creators that interest you. If you are too self-conscious when you tweet, you can write in a notepad or something.</p> <p>Practice speaking alone or in your head: Try saying out parts or a not-to-difficult line of thought. You should have a high enough JP level that you kind of get a feeling what is wrong. So you correct yourself until you have reasonably okay Japanese, even if you may not know the most natural way JP say it. The biggest advantage of this is you can do it any time, it's pressure-free, and you have unlimited time to recall words and correct your speech. If you are still getting stuck not being able to say what you want even with time, it may be one of the following: Your subject matter is too complex or has too many words that you don't have in your passive vocab You haven't gotten enough exposure to native materials in that area (for example, it can be hard to voice your opinions simply, if you've only read fiction and not twitter, because the common/useful phrases are different. Your overall JP level is not high enough so you can't correct yourself well enough. #2 is more important and almost always you can succeed by immersing in similar native materials (this is how conversation-centric learners can get pretty good at talking, even though their overall knowledge is worse than someone who has read widely)</p> <p>General Tips: Try to imitate what you've seen, as much as possible don't construct your own forms. Try to speak about relatively simple topics to start. Stuff like \"I sure wanna go travelling\" is nice basic output Speaking areas are somewhat mutually exclusive: if you practice talking analytically, you can actually become okay at talking about concepts, but be unable to say basic things. The takeaway is, feel free to specialize in talking about what you want, but remember to practice essential stuff too. Start by saying fragments, 0.5-3 sentence long bits, instead of trying to convey a whole conversation/opinion all at once. There are going to be feelings/sentences that you just don't know the grammar to express, I recommend replacing it with something similar that you do know, even if it's not exactly the same. Or skip it. To get better at this, immerse in more native conversation. Lastly, try to learn how to say things in the simplest way. Stiff/pompous language is not practical and is not what you want popping up in your head when you are trying to talk for real. \u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u73fe\u72b6\u628a\u63e1\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002\u9023\u7d61\u304c\u6765\u308b\u6b21\u7b2c\u3001\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u308b\u3000\u2717\u3000 \u305d\u308c\u306f\u3001\u5206\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\u805e\u3044\u305f\u3089\u6559\u3048\u307e\u3059\u3002\u25ce \u305d\u308c\u306b\u95a2\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3001\u4e00\u9577\u4e00\u77ed\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u306a\u304f\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u3001\u3055\u304b\u3057... \u2717 \u826f\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3082\u60aa\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3051\u3069\u3001\u53d6\u308a\u6562\u3048\u305a\u3053\u308c\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\uff1f\u25ce</p> <p>Internalizing Intent vs phrase I'm sure all of you have experienced this. When you are intermediate level, you can have this time where you have all sorts of random JP phrases pop up in your head. This is cool and means that you've reached a milestone in your immersion journey.</p> <p>However, from experience I've found this type of random output is not useful in practical situations. Even though you can remember phrases from what you've read you get stuck unable to think of the phrase you need. </p> <p>How you fix this problem is also the core of how you should be practicing output. Remember that simple phrase \"I sure wanna go travelling\" \u300c\u65c5\u884c\u306b\u884c\u304d\u305f\u3044\u306a\u2026\u300d? The point is to connect/associate that internal feeling of that with the phrase (or the feeling when you want to express that concept). That works especially well with phrases that express a feeling, but also works with objective phrases too.</p> <p>Timeline:</p> <p>I think after 3 months of outputting on twitter you will notice a big improvement. If you tweet for 1 year you should be somewhat comfortable on the stuff you normally talk about. The input from reading twitter is really important so don't slack on that too.</p> <p>For paragraph writing, don't worry if your paragraphs are really wacky. Keep it simple, stick to stuff you've heard before, and immerse in more similar native materials. Eventually your paragraphs will look natural enough, as you have learned enough useful structures that you don't have to resort to your own contrived phrasing.</p> <p>For paragraph writing, I think your output can become sane-looking within 2-3 years after you hit N1 level immersing. If you immerse in a lot of blogs/relevant material and practice a bit it can be as low as 1 year.</p> <p>I\u2019m still slow AF for writing and messaging, so don\u2019t ask me how to become faster. Probably it\u2019s being less of a perfectionist: just write stuff out, make mistakes, and get corrected later. From there how you can go to the next level is use Japanese in order to do something with natives. The more different types of activities you do, the more proficient/adept you will become at doing stuff in JP.</p> <p>General advice: Conversations are good, especially with people who you share something in common with. Practical conversation is really good (like sending emails, playing a game together, interacting on twitter) Anytime you have to use Japanese for practical purposes (hobby, reading how to do something) is really good for internalization. Being in a situation where you a forced to use Japanese is really good (prep helps too)</p>"},{"location":"visual_novel/","title":"Visual Novel","text":"<p>visual novel</p>"},{"location":"yomitan/","title":"Yomitan","text":"<p>ini tutorial buat yomitan oke</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/10-helper-verbs-the-potential-helper-verb/","title":"10.

And I only mention this word because I don't want you to get confused if you see <code>conjugation</code> referred to somewhere else. </p> <p>When they talk about <code>conjugation</code>, this is what they mean. But in fact there is no such thing as conjugation in Japanese. All we ever do is add helper-words to the four verb stems. And there are a lot of helper-words and most of them are just a question of extra vocabulary so long as you don't think of them as conjugation. </p> <p></p> <p>In some cases they get called <code>conjugation</code>, in other cases they don't, and they're exactly the same process every time. The only difference is that some of them happen to accidentally, and only very vaguely, resemble European conjugation and others don't. All kinds of confusions arise from confusing Japanese helper-verbs and helper-adjectives with conjugations, but because we're not going to use them, we don't need to worry about that here. All right.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/10-helper-verbs-the-potential-helper-verb/#the-potential-helper-verb","title":"The potential helper verb","text":"<p>So, the first main helper-verb we're going to look at is the potential verb. Now, we've already looked, haven't we, at helper-words. We've looked at the helper-adjectives <code>\u306a\u3044</code>, which forms the negative, and <code>\u305f\u3044</code>, which is used for the desirability of an action.</p> <p></p> <p>We've also looked at the helper-verb <code>\u304c\u308b</code>, which is attached to an adjective. Now we're going to look at the potential helper-verb, and this attaches to the \u3048-stem. </p> <p></p> <p>There aren't as many things we do with the \u3048-stem as we do with the \u3042 and \u3044-stems, but there are some. And only one of them is a verb, so there's no room for confusion here. The potential helper-verb has two forms, and they are <code>-\u308b</code> and <code>-\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>.</p> <p>People can be a little disconcerted by the godan form of the helper-verb because it's just one character, \u308b(ru). But that shouldn't worry you at all, and because it only ever goes onto the \u3048-stem, can't be used on its own, it's very very easy to recognize. </p> <p><code>-\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> is the form of the potential helper-verb that goes onto ichidan verbs \u2013 and we discussed godan and ichidan verbs before, didn't we? So, <code>\u304b\u3046</code> (buy) becomes <code>\u304b\u3048\u308b</code> (buy-able); <code>\u304d\u304f</code> (hear) becomes <code>\u304d\u3051\u308b</code> (hear-able); <code>\u306f\u306a\u3059</code> (speak) becomes <code>\u306f\u306a\u305b\u308b</code> (speak-able); <code>\u3082\u3064</code> (hold) becomes <code>\u3082\u3066\u308b</code> (hold-able) and so forth.</p> <p>::: info change to \u3048-stem and then the godan potential form \u308b. Also note this\u2026  </p> <p></p> <p>There is some difference in their implication, Dolly clears them up further in LESSON 54. Dolly SEEMS to make an error here by calling \u805e\u3053\u3048\u308b other-move, but it should be self-move as she implies in the beginning of the comment (+in comparison to other sources like Imabi). :::</p> <p>And with <code>\u305f\u3079\u308b</code>, which is an ichidan verb, we do what we always do, simply take off the -\u308b and put on whatever we're going to put on. So <code>\u305f\u3079\u308b</code> (eat) becomes <code>\u305f\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> (eat-able). So this is very simple, isn't it?</p> <p>There are only two exceptions to this formation of the potential form and they are the two Japanese irregular verbs, <code>\u304f\u308b</code> and <code>\u3059\u308b</code>. <code>\u304f\u308b</code> become <code>\u3053\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>, but <code>\u3059\u308b</code> surprisingly becomes <code>\u3067\u304d\u308b</code>. \u3067\u304d\u308b is the potential form of <code>\u3059\u308b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And this is an interesting word because it also means <code>come out</code> \u2013 literally it's made up of the kanji <code>out</code> and <code>come</code> \u2013 <code>\u51fa\u6765\u308b/\u3067\u304d\u308b</code>, \u51fa\u308b (exit) \u6765\u308b (come)</p> <p></p> <p>And if we say <code>\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3054\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b</code>, we're not saying <code>I can do Japanese</code>, we're saying <code>Japanese is possible</code> / <code>does</code> possible</p> <p></p> <p>And if we say or imply <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3054\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b</code>, we're saying, <code>To me, Japanese is possible</code>. </p> <p>:::info (Dolly gives <code>does possible</code> to imply it\u2019s A does B; not A is B)  :::</p> <p>And it's interesting if you see a small child perhaps trying to make something out of paper, she may say, <code>I'm trying very hard, but it won't come out right</code> \u2013 and this is just the way \u3067\u304d\u308b is used in Japanese, isn't it? And there are some interesting ways in which \u3067\u304d\u308b is used which show how the idea of something being possible and something coming out are closely linked in the Japanese language. But we won't talk about that now \u2013 that's a little bit more advanced.</p> <p>There's only one danger area with the potential form, and it's very very close to something we dealt with last week (Lesson 9). So if you've seen that lesson, this one should be very easy to you. Let's look at a typical sentence: <code>\u307b\u3093\u304c\u3088\u3081\u308b.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, the standard texts usually translate this as <code>I can read the book</code>. But that isn't what it means, as you can clearly understand if you followed our previous lesson. Look where the \u304c is. The \u304c is marking what? It's marking the book! So who is the actor of this sentence? It's the book.</p> <p></p> <p>We are saying something about the book. So the book is the main car and <code>\u3088\u3081\u308b</code> is the engine. We are saying the book is readable, it's possible to read the book.</p> <p>If we add <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f</code>, we are saying the book is readable <code>to me</code>. What we are literally saying is, <code>In relation to me, the book is readable</code>. But this does not and cannot mean, <code>I can read the book</code>. If we wanted to say <code>I can read the book</code>, the book would have to be marked by \u3092, wouldn't it? And I would have to be marked by \u304c. And it is in fact possible to do this, but it's not what is usually done.</p> <p>But also remember that if we want to put stress on the ego, the way English wants to, then we have to change the particles. If we literally want to say, <code>I can read the book</code> \u2013 <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u304c\u307b\u3093\u3092\u3088\u3081\u308b</code>. </p> <p>A lot of people think this is bad Japanese.</p> <p>::: info I guess it isn\u2019t how the Japanese tend to speak. It could be called <code>Englishised</code> Japanese as it puts emphasis on the ego first, as the subject, which isn\u2019t how they tend to think in Japan. :::</p> <p>Not our place to work out whether it is or isn't bad Japanese. The point is that most of the time you will see <code>\u307b\u3093\u304c\u3088\u3081\u308b</code>, and <code>(\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f)\u307b\u3093\u304c\u3088\u3081\u308b</code> can't literally mean <code>I can read the book</code>. It means <code>The book is readable</code>.</p> <p>::: info Can say \u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f to imply book does readable TO ME - a topic, but it\u2019s usually not mentioned :::</p> <p>So that's simple enough, and provided we remember that, we don't send all those particles into crazy illogicality.</p> <p></p> <p>So really this is very much similar to the questions we discussed last week about -\u305f\u3044 and adjectives of desire. If we just keep that \u304c straight in our minds, everything else will fall into place. And just as with the \u305f\u3044-form if we say, <code>(\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f)\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u304c\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044</code>, </p> <p></p> <p>it's the cake that\u2019s being want-inducing (to me personally - topic), but if we just say <code>(\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f)(zero\u304c)\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044</code> we do mean <code>(In relation to me) (I) want to eat</code> / eat-wanting-am,</p> <p></p> <p>because when there's no particular food there to do the being wanted, then I do the wanting. </p> <p>::: info</p> <p>I\u2019m the subject that just wants to eat something because I\u2019m hungry; here I\u2019m also the topic</p> <p>However, do note that no food is present there, so it defaults to <code>me</code>. Zero\u304c (and also zero\u306f) is dependent on the context of the situation/sentence, Dolly says...</p> <p> :::</p> <p>It's the same with the potential form. So we say, <code>(\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f)\u307b\u3093\u304c\u3088\u3081\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>(to me) the book is read-able</code>,</p> <p></p> <p>but if we just want to say <code>I can read</code> \u2013 not \"I can read the book or I can read the newspaper or I can read Sakura's secret diary\", but <code>I can read</code> \u2013 then we say <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u304c\u3088\u3081\u308b</code> or just <code>\u3088\u3081\u308b</code>, which means <code>(zero\u304c)\u3088\u3081\u308b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And we really have become the subject of the sentence. And I am sure there are people who find this confusing, but if you followed the past lesson this should be completely clear. </p> <p>And let's remember that Japanese always fits together just like Lego,</p> <p></p> <p>so the potential helper-verb, even when it's just that single kana \u308b(ru), is simply a regular ichidan verb like most helper-verbs, and we can do exactly the same things with it that we can do with other helper-verbs.</p> <p>::: info I guess Dolly means the potential helper works like ichidan, so if adding anything to the potential, remove the \u308b as with any ichidan and attach to the \u3048-stem. Dolly\u2019s replies under one comment</p> <p>The <code>potential form</code> of godan verbs is ichidan because the \u308b helper is ichidan\u2026 Godan is a red herring here. As soon as we attach any ichidan helper to a godan verb we are dealing with an ichidan entity and anything we do after that follows the ichidan pattern\u2026So there is no question of a godan verb becoming ichidan. What is happening is that a godan verb is attaching an ichidan helper. :::</p> <p>We'll always recognize it, because it's the only one that goes onto the \u3048-stem, and we can do everything with it that we do with any other ichidan verb.</p> <p></p> <p>So: <code>\u3042\u308b\u3051\u308b</code> \u2013 can walk; <code>\u3042\u308b\u3051\u306a\u3044</code> \u2013 can't walk; <code>\u3042\u308b\u3051\u305f</code> \u2013 could walk; <code>\u3042\u308b\u3051\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> \u2013 couldn't walk. And this regularity is the same even with the irregulars. So: \u3067\u304d\u308b \u2013 possible; <code>\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044</code> \u2013 not possible; <code>\u3067\u304d\u305f</code> \u2013 was possible; <code>\u3067\u304d\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> \u2013 wasn't possible.</p> <p>And it's really as easy as that.</p> <p>::: info I got quite confused, since I looked up \u51fa\u6765\u308b/\u3067\u304d\u308b in Jisho and they actually show that it has a potential form of <code>\u3067\u304d\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> which is interesting since \u3067\u304d\u308b should already imply the potential form. I looked up some Japanese forums (and others) and it seems that even the Japanese?? found \u3067\u304d\u3089\u308c\u308b weird. Or it could be an honorific form?\u2026 Correct me if wrong\u2026 E.g. \u5206\u304b\u308b also has no potential form, as it implies it. Dolly explains <code>\u5206\u304b\u308c\u308b</code> is another word :::</p> <p>::: info I will also add some regular ichidan verb example.</p> <p><code>\u305f\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> - can eat; <code>\u305f\u3079\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044</code> - can\u2019t eat; <code>\u305f\u3079\u3089\u308c\u305f</code> - could eat; <code>\u305f\u3079\u3089\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> - couldn\u2019t eat. :::</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/11-compound-sentences-%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8C%E3%82%8B-%E3%81%82%E3%81%92%E3%82%8B-and-more-uses-of-the-%E3%81%A6-form/","title":"11.

We've learned enough now that we can start looking at some real narrative. It'll be a little simplified at first, but we can use this to bring together the things we've learned so far. We'll also be learning new structural elements because even in the simplest story we're going to encounter things that we need to learn. But this may be a more interesting way of doing it. So please let me know what you think in the comments below. All right. </p> <p>Now let's go into a story that I believe we all know.</p> <p><code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u306f\u5ddd\u306e\u305d\u3070\u306b\u3044\u305f.</code></p> <p>Now, this is a simple sentence. The word <code>\u5ddd/\u304b\u308f</code> means <code>river</code>, and <code>\u305d\u3070</code> means <code>beside</code> and it's a noun. </p> <p></p> <p>So <code>\u5ddd\u306e\u305d\u3070</code> is <code>the beside of the river</code>. Just as we put something on the <code>on</code> of the table or the <code>under</code> of the table and we also always mark it with \u306b, so the <code>beside of the river</code> is where Alice was.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u3042\u308b</code> means <code>a certain</code>, so <code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5</code> is like <code>one day</code> or <code>a certain day</code>, and let's notice that what's happening here is what we've seen before. <code>\u3042\u308b</code> is the verb that means <code>exist</code> or <code>be</code>, and what we've done here is what we've seen in the video lesson on so-called adjectives. (Lesson 6) We can make any engine into an adjective. So, <code>\u3042\u308b</code> is an <code>A does B</code> engine, an \u3046-engine, so if we say <code>\u672c\u304c\u3042\u308b</code> we are saying, <code>There is a book / a book exists</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And if we move that <code>\u3042\u308b</code> engine to the other side of the book, we turn it white and it becomes a descriptor, an adjectival. So we're saying <code>\u3042\u308b\u672c</code> \u2013 <code>an existing book / a certain book / a book that there is</code>. </p> <p></p> <p>And it's the same: <code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5</code> \u2013 <code>a certain day</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u306f\u5ddd\u306e\u305d\u3070\u306b\u3044\u305f</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, the next sentence is going to be a little bit more complex, but don't worry, it's always easy when there's a fully-functioning android to help you. (Actually, I'm not quite fully-functioning, but for the purposes of showing you Japanese I am.)</p> <p><code>\u304a\u306d\u3048\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u3064\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u672c\u3092\u3088\u3093\u3067\u3044\u3066\u3042\u305d\u3093\u3067\u304f\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code></p> <p></p> <p>So we've got quite a complex sentence here, and let's break it down. <code>\u304a\u306d\u3048\u3061\u3083\u3093</code> means <code>big sister</code>: <code>\u306d\u3048</code> is <code>sister</code>; <code>-\u3061\u3083\u3093</code>, I'm sure you know, is a cute, friendly honorific; <code>\u304a-</code> is also an honorific. So, <code>\u304a\u306d\u3048\u3061\u3083\u3093</code> \u2013 <code>big sister</code>. </p> <p><code>\u3064\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044</code> means <code>dull</code> or <code>boring</code>. <code>\u672c</code>, as we know, is <code>book</code>. <code>\u3088\u3080</code> means <code>read</code>; <code>\u3088\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b</code> \u2013 we put the <code>\u3088\u3080</code> into the \u3066-form and add <code>\u3044\u308b</code> and it means <code>is reading</code>; and then we put the <code>\u3044\u308b</code> itself into the \u3066-form.</p> <p>So why are we doing all that? Let's take a look. <code>\u304a\u306d\u3048\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u3064\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u672c\u3092\u3088\u3093\u3067\u3044\u3066</code> \u2013 <code>Big sister is reading a boring book</code>\u2013 but then that -\u3066.... \u3066-form has a lot of different uses. In this case it will complete a clause. <code>Big sister is reading a boring book</code> \u2013 that's a complete clause, isn't it? </p> <p></p> <p>And if we turn that final \u3046-engine into the \u3066-form, what we're saying is that something else is going to follow this clause. We are indicating that we're making a complex sentence made up of more than one clause. So it's like saying, <code>Big sister was reading a boring book **and...**</code> And that something else comes: <code>\u3042\u305d\u3093\u3067\u304f\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>. </p> <p></p> <p><code>\u3042\u305d\u3076</code> means to <code>play</code>, and that also is in the \u3066-form, isn't it? <code>\u3042\u305d\u3076</code> --&gt; \u3042\u305d\u3093\u3067\". If you're in any doubt of how we make these \u3066-forms, please go back to the video lesson on the \u3066-form and refresh your memory. (Lesson 5)</p> <p><code>\u3042\u305d\u3093\u3067\u304f\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> </p> <p>Now this is another use of the \u3066-form. \u3066-form is terribly important and it does various different things. What's it doing here? Well, <code>\u3042\u305d\u3076</code>, as we know, means <code>play</code>. </p> <p><code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> means to <code>give</code>, and it specifically means <code>give downwards</code>. And the reason we say <code>give downwards</code> in Japanese is because we are always polite to people. So we always represent ourselves as being below other people and other people as being above ourselves. </p> <p></p> <p>So if I say <code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> (give), I always mean that someone is giving something to me or to someone close to me. </p> <p>But what is Alice's big sister giving \u2013 or not giving \u2013 to Alice?</p> <p></p> <p>Well, it's not the book. In fact, it's not any actual object. She is giving the action to which <code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> is connected by the \u3066-form. She is giving \u2013 or in this case, not giving \u2013 the act of playing to Alice.</p> <p>What do we mean by that? Well, we say <code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> not only for giving a thing \u2013 a book, a present, a candy \u2013 we also say it for giving an action, for doing something for our benefit. This is very very often used in Japanese, so it's important to understand it. If someone does something for our benefit, we turn that action to \u3066-form and we add <code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code>. If we do something for someone else's benefit, we turn that action into te-form and add <code>\u3042\u3052\u308b</code>, which means to <code>give upward</code>, in other words, to give to you, to give to another person.</p> <p><code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> and <code>\u3042\u3052\u308b</code> \u2013 give down to me or my group / [<code>**\u3042\u3052\u308b**</code>] give up to you or someone else or your group or their group.</p> <p>So what is this second part of the sentence? It's <code>\u3042\u305d\u3093\u3067\u304f\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> \u2013 \"she didn't play / she didn't give Alice playing-with / she didn't play for Alice's benefit\".</p> <p></p> <p>It's rather different from anything we find in English, but it's also very expressive, something we could actually do with having in English. </p> <p>So now let's look at the whole sentence again. <code>\u304a\u306d\u3048\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u3064\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u672c\u3092\u3088\u3093\u3067\u3044\u3066\u3042\u305d\u3093\u3067\u304f\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>Big sister was reading a boring book and did not play \\[with Alice\\]</code>. </p> <p></p> <p>Notice that we have two complete clauses here:  Clause 1: <code>\u304a\u306d\u3048\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u3064\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u672c\u3092\u3088\u3093\u3060</code> \u2013 that's a complete clause in itself, isn't it?</p> <p>Clause 2: <code>\u304a\u306d\u3048\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u3042\u305d\u3093\u3067\u304f\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>Oneechan did not play for Alice's benefit</code></p> <p>And we've connected the two together with the \u3066-form.</p> <p>A thing we should notice here is that <code>\u304a\u306d\u3048\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u3064\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u672c\u3092\u3088\u3093\u3067</code> doesn't tell us the tense. We don't know whether she's reading a boring book right now or in the future or in the past. We don't know that until we get to the end of the sentence. </p> <p></p> <p>In English we put the tense marker on both halves of a complex sentence. We would say, <code>Big sister WAS reading a boring book...</code> so we already know that it's in the past. But in Japanese we put that tense marker, -\u305f or -\u304b\u3063\u305f, at the end and we only need one tense marker per sentence.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u3088\u3093\u3067\u3044\u3066</code> could mean <code>is reading</code> or could mean <code>was reading</code>, but because the <code>\u3042\u305d\u3093\u3067\u304f\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> is in the past and it's part of the same sentence we have put everything into the past.</p> <p>Well, we didn't get very far into Alice's adventure today, did we? But we can proceed faster as we get used to real text and learn the basic narrative structures.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/12-quotation-particle-%E3%81%A8-compound-verbs-nouns/","title":"12.

So let's refresh our minds on the story we've read so far.</p> <p>\u3042\u308b\u65e5\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u306f\u5ddd\u306e\u305d\u3070\u306b\u3044\u305f\u3002</p> <p>(One day Alice was by the river.)</p> <p>\u304a\u59c9\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u3064\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u672c\u3092\u3088\u3093\u3067\u3044\u3066\u3042\u305d\u3093\u3067\u304f\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002</p> <p>(Big sister was reading a boring book and did not play with Alice.)</p> <p>\u300c\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u306a\u3044\u300d\u3068\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u306f\u8a00\u3063\u305f\u3002</p> <p></p> <p>\u300c\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044\u300d means <code>interesting or amusing</code>; \u300c\u3053\u3068\u300d means <code>a thing</code>. And in Japanese we have two common words for <code>thing</code> , and they are \u3082\u306e and \u3053\u3068.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, a \u3082\u306e is a thing in the most usual sense: a physical thing \u2013 a hat, a book, a pair of glasses, Mount Fuji. \u3053\u3068 is a more abstract kind of <code>thing</code>: an affair, a matter, a circumstance. So, when we say, <code>Is there anything in that box?</code> we mean \u3082\u306e. And when we say, <code>The thing is...</code> we usually mean \u3053\u3068. </p> <p>So, \u300c\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u306a\u3044\u300dmeans <code>There's nothing interesting going on here, no interesting circumstance.</code></p> <p>\u8a00\u3063\u305f \uff0d \u8a00\u3046 means <code>say</code> and you can see it's like a mouth with soundwaves coming out of it. </p> <p></p> <p>But the important thing to notice here is that little particle \u3068.</p> <p></p> <p>There are actually two \u3068 particles: one means <code>and</code> and it's very simple; the other one is what we call the <code>quotation particle</code>, and that's what we're dealing with here. When we quote someone as saying something or even as thinking something, we use this particle \u3068. It's kind of like a quotation mark that you can hear. </p> <p>As you see, we use the square quotation marks in Japanese, which are the equivalent to English quotation marks, but we also use the \u3068. So we don't just say, <code>'Nothing interesting is happening,' Alice said</code>. We say, <code>'Nothing interesting is happening,' **\u3068** Alice said</code>. Now, \u3068 is a very interesting particle structurally and we're going to look into that a little more deeply in a few minutes.</p> <p>\u305d\u306e\u3068\u304d\u3001\u767d\u3044\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u304c\u3068\u304a\u308a\u3059\u304e\u305f\u3002</p> <p></p> <p>\u300c\u305d\u306e\u3068\u304d\u300d: \u305d\u306e means <code>that</code> and \u3068\u304d means <code>time</code>, so we're literally saying thattime, <code>but this is a bit more like saying</code> just then / at that moment / at that time. So we use just the way we use other relative time expressions: we don't need to put \u306b or anything else with it, we just state the time and then continue with what was happening at that time.</p> <p>In this particular sentence, the point of \u300c\u305d\u306e\u3068\u304d\u300d is that just at that moment when Alice had been saying that there was nothing interesting happening, just at that time, this happened.</p> <p>\u305d\u306e\u3068\u304d\u3001\u767d\u3044\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u304c\u3068\u304a\u308a\u3059\u304e\u305f\u3002</p> <p>\u767d\u3044 means <code>white</code>; it's an \u3044-adjective. \u30a6\u30b5\u30ae means <code>rabbit</code>. And \u300c\u3068\u304a\u308a\u3059\u304e\u305f\u300dis made up of two words, and it's doing something that we're going to see over and over and over again in Japanese. It's using the \u3044-stem of one verb to attach another verb to give it extra meaning. So \u3068\u304a\u308b means to <code>pass through</code> and \u3059\u304e\u308b means to <code>exceed or go beyond</code>. So \u3068\u304a\u308a\u3059\u304e\u308b connects those two words together: \u3068\u304a\u308b (pass through); \u3059\u304e\u308b (go beyond) and it means <code>passing by</code>. A white rabbit passed by. </p> <p></p> <p>\u305d\u306e\u3068\u304d\u3001\u767d\u3044\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae (white rabbit) \u3068\u304a\u308a\u3059\u304e\u305f (passed by)\u3002</p> <p>\u3075\u3064\u3046\u306e\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3001\u30c1\u30e7\u30c3\u30ad\u3092\u304d\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002</p> <p></p> <p>\u3075\u3064\u3046\u306e\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3066\u2026</p> <p>Now, \u3075\u3064\u3046 means <code>ordinary</code>, and the rest of this you already know. \u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044 means <code>it isn't / it wasn't</code> and we're putting into the \u3066-form because this is part of a complex sentence \u2013 and we looked at complex sentences last week, didn't we? </p> <p>(Lesson 11, Dolly gives 7, but it might be an error since \u3066-form isn\u2019t there\u2026 but check also 5)</p> <p>So, \u300c\u3075\u3064\u3046\u306e\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3066\u300d= <code>It was not an ordinary rabbit.</code></p> <p>\u2026\u30c1\u30e7\u30c3\u30ad\u3092\u304d\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002</p> <p>\u30c1\u30e7\u30c3\u30ad means a vest; \u304d\u308b means <code>wear</code>, so \u300c\u304d\u3066\u3044\u308b\u300d means to <code>be wearing / be in the act of wearing</code>. And <code>\u3060\u3063\u305f</code>, of course, is the past tense of the copula. </p> <p></p> <p>So this is: <code>It was not an ordinary rabbit, it was a wearing-a-vest rabbit / it was a rabbit that was wearing a vest.</code></p> <p>\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u306f\u304b\u3044\u3061\u3085\u3046\u3069\u3051\u3044\u3092\u898b\u3066\u300c\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u300d\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3001\u306f\u3057\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002</p> <p></p> <p>\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u306f\u304b\u3044\u3061\u3085\u3046\u3069\u3051\u3044\u3092\u898b\u3066\u2026</p> <p>\u304b\u3044\u3061\u3085\u3046\u3069\u3051\u3044 is not a word we're going to encounter all that often because there aren't many of them around these days, but it is an example of something we're going to see an awful lot, which is that in Japanese, as you know, we can modify one noun with another by marking the first one with \u306e (or \u306a, which is a form of \u3060) but we can also, when we're not just modifying one noun with another but forming a new noun, we can simply ram them together. </p> <p>We don't have to modify them in any way, the way we do with verbs (we turn them into the \u3044-stem), but you can't do that with nouns, nouns don't have any stems, they don't modify in any way \u2013 so, when you're putting two nouns together to make a new noun, you simply push them into each other. This is the same as what we do in English, with words like seaweed or bookshelf. We just push two nouns together to make a new noun.</p> <p>So the parts of this noun, \u300c\u304b\u3044\u3061\u3085\u3046\u3069\u3051\u3044\u300d: \u304b\u3044\u3061\u3085\u3046/\u61d0\u4e2d is a slightly unusual noun \u2013 it means <code>in one's pocket or the inside of one's pocket</code> and \u3068\u3051\u3044/\u6642\u8a08 is a very common word \u2013 it means <code>clock or watch</code> (we have the same word for a clock in Japanese whether it's a small one or a big one), so \u304b\u3044\u3061\u3085\u3046\u3069\u3051\u3044/\u61d0\u4e2d\u6642\u8a08 is a pocket watch.</p> <p>And the reason we say \u300c\u3069\u3051\u3044\u300dinstead of \u300c\u3068\u3051\u3044\u300d is what Alice in \"Alice in Kanji Land calls \"ten-ten hooking\", and this is that when you push two nouns together, in the way that we are doing here, and the second one begins with a sharp sound like <code>t</code> or <code>k</code>, we turn it into its equivalent dull sound like <code>d</code> or <code>b</code>. (=Rendaku - sequential voicing)</p> <p></p> <p>::: info It USUALLY seems to happen when the 2nd noun in the compound has a sharp Kun\u2019yomi sound that has an equivalent dull sound - h -&gt; b, t -&gt; d, k -&gt; g, tsu/s -&gt; z, sh -&gt; j etc. On\u2019yomi compounds USUALLY don\u2019t have this change, SOMETIMES, if <code>n</code> is before, it can trigger it too. :::</p> <p>And of course in Japanese you do this by adding those two small marks \u309b(\u3060\u304f\u3066\u3093) to the kana, so \u3068 becomes \u3069, \u305f becomes \u3060, \u304f becomes \u3050, \u3055 becomes \u3056 etc. </p> <p>So, for example, \u3042\u304a is blue, as you know, \u305d\u3089 is <code>sky</code> and when you put them together you get not \u3042\u304a\u305d\u3089 but \u3042\u304a\u305e\u3089. We put the ten-ten onto that sharp word, and Alice calls that <code>ten-ten hooking</code>. (ten-ten, lit. <code>dot-dot</code>, seems to be a colloquial name for dakuten \u309b)</p> <p>It's as if those two little points, those two little claws, hook into the word before it to turn them into a single word. It's a thing you're going to see very often. </p> <p>And just as in English you can't do this with any two nouns, but there are a lot of nouns that are made up of two nouns and so long as one of the nouns isn't a slightly unusual one like \u304b\u3044\u3061\u3085\u3046, they're very easy to understand, just as they are in English.</p> <p>And then we have: </p> <p>\u300e\u2026\u300c\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u300d\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u2026\u300f</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/12-quotation-particle-%E3%81%A8-compound-verbs-nouns/#the-quotation-particle","title":"The \u3068 quotation particle","text":"<p>Now, we're going to look at what this \u3068 actually does, and as we get into more complex sentences, three-level compound sentences like this one, we start to see how useful it becomes.</p> <p></p> <p>What \u3068 actually does structurally is that it takes whatever it marks \u2013 and that could be two words like this or it could be a whole paragraph with all kinds of other grammar going on in it \u2013 it takes whatever it marks as a quotation and turns it effectively into a single noun.</p> <p>So a \u3068 carriage is a white noun-carriage marked with \u3068. And we're going to find as we go on that this is used not only to mark things people say and things people think, but all kinds of other things. And we'll have an example of that a little later in this lesson. But this \u3068 structure is essentially making a quasi-noun out of whatever is marked with \u3068, and the \u3068 then makes it function as a modifier to the verb that follows.</p> <p></p> <p>When it's a simple quotation like that, the verb is going to be \u8a00\u3046 (to say), but it could also be \u8003\u3048\u308b (to think) or \u601d\u3046 (to think or feel), but it can be many other things too, as you're going to see in a moment. So this is the structure of a \u3068 marked statement of any kind.</p> <p>\u300e\u300c\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u300d\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3001\u306f\u3057\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002\u300f</p> <p>\u304a\u305d\u3044 means <code>late</code>. And in order to make it a sentence, obviously we have to have a zero-pronoun here. So the rabbit is either saying <code>It's late!</code> or <code>I'm late!</code></p> <p></p> <p>\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u306f(zero\u304c)\u304b\u3044\u3061\u3085\u3046\u3069\u3051\u3044\u3092\u898b\u3066\u300c\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u300d\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3001\u306f\u3057\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002</p> <p>Rabbit as for (it/he) pocket watch looked-and <code>late! late!</code> said-and run-broke out.</p> <p>In the Disney version, of course, it was <code>I'm late!</code></p> <p>\u300c\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u304a\u305d\u3044!\u300d( <code>I'm late! I'm late!</code>)</p> <p>We don't need to say \u3068 with \u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u306f\u8a00\u3063\u3066 this time because we've got \u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u306f at the beginning of the sentence and this is a compound sentence. So the second part of the compound sentence has the same main carriage, the same subject as the first half.</p> <p>\u300e\u300c\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u300d\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u2026\u300f</p> <p>( <code>The rabbit said, **I**m late! I'm late!'</code>)</p> <p>And that \u8a00\u3063\u3066 is another compound \u8a00\u3063\u3066, so this time we have a three deep compound sentence.</p> <p></p> <p>::: info Blue box - the quoted rabbit\u2019s words also seem to have a zero\u304c since meaning (I) late. :::</p> <p>The rabbit looked at his watch, he said \u300c\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u300d, and then... he did something else:</p> <p>\u306f\u3057\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002</p> <p>\u306f\u3057\u308b means <code>run</code> and \u51fa\u3059 literally means to <code>take out</code>, but this is a combination we're going to see very often in Japanese. Once again, we're using that \u3044-stem , which is the main connecting stem, to connect \u306f\u3057\u308b to \u51fa\u3059. And what does it mean here?</p> <p></p> <p>Well, that \u51fa\u3059 when it's connected to a verb means that the action of the verb <code>erupted</code>. So we can say that someone \u6ce3\u304d\u51fa\u3057\u305f: \u6ce3\u304f/\u306a\u304f is <code>cry</code>, and we connect the \u3044 stem of \u6ce3\u304fto \u51fa\u3059, and \u6ce3\u304d\u51fa\u3059 means <code>burst out crying</code>. We can say \u7b11\u3044\u51fa\u3059: \u7b11\u3046 is <code>laugh</code> and if we connect the \u3044-stem of \u7b11\u3046 to \u51fa\u3059, we're saying <code>burst out laughing</code>. And in this case what happened? The rabbit suddenly burst out running \u2013 it broke into a run.</p> <p>\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u306f\u304b\u3044\u3061\u3085\u3046\u3069\u3051\u3044\u3092\u898b\u3066\u300c\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u304a\u305d\u3044\uff01\u300d\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3001\u306f\u3057\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002</p> <p>(The rabbit looked at its pocket watch, it cried Im late! I'm late!' and it broke into running.)</p> <p></p> <p>\u300c\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u307e\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u300d\u3068\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u306f\u3088\u3093\u3060\u3002</p> <p></p> <p>\u300c\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u307e\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u300dis a phrase you're going to hear a lot in Japanese. Sometimes the \u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 will get left off. What does it mean? </p> <p>\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068 means <code>a little</code>; \u307e\u3063\u3066 is the \u3066-form of <code>\u5f85\u3064/\u307e\u3064</code>, which means to <code>wait</code>; and \u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 means <code>please</code>. It's actually connected with \u304f\u308c\u308b, which we talked about last time (lesson 11); which also refers to giving down \u2013 it's <code>please give down to me / please lower down to my level</code>, so that's a polite way of saying <code>please give</code>. But it's not just giving a thing, just as with \u304f\u308c\u308b and \u3042\u3052\u308b, it's not just giving a thing, it can also be, if you connect it to the \u3066-form of a verb, giving the action of that verb. So you can see it's very related to that \u304f\u308c\u308b and \u3042\u3052\u308b that we learned last week.</p> <p>\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u307e\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044</p> <p>Now, because this is so common, very often when we put a verb into \u3066-form and address it to someone, it's kind of short for \u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044. \u300c\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u307e\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u300dmeans <code>Please wait a little</code>.

Well, we've come across \u3088\u3093\u3060 before I think, haven't we? And it means <code>read</code>, <code>read</code> in the past. That is the \u305f form \u2014the \u3060-form in this case\u2014of \u8aad\u3080. But in this case it's different. It's the \u3060 form of \u547c\u3076.</p> <p></p> <p>If you remember from our \u3066 and \u305f form lesson (Lesson 5), the New Boom group of verbs, \u306c, \u3076, and \u3080 ending verbs, all form their \u3066 form with \u3093\u3067 and their \u305f form with \u3093\u3060. So both \u8aad\u3080 and \u547c\u3076 have the past form \u3088\u3093\u3060. Fortunately, we're not very often likely to get reading and calling mixed up, are we? This \u547c\u3076 means to <code>call</code>, to <code>shout out</code>. It can mean <code>call</code> in any of the senses that <code>call</code> is used in English. You can call someone a name, you can call an apple a lemon (but you'd be wrong) or you can call out.</p> <p>\u300c\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u307e\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u300d\u3068\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u306f\u3088\u3093\u3060\u3002</p> <p>(\u2018Please wait a minute!' called Alice.)</p> <p>\u3067\u3082\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u306f\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u306f\u3057\u308a\u3064\u3065\u3051\u305f\u3002</p> <p></p> <p>::: tip If you want to type \u7d9a\u3051\u308b/\u3064\u3065\u3051\u308b, you must type tsuDUkeru. Dzu gives <code>\uff44\u305a</code>. :::</p> <p>\u3067\u3082 means <code>but</code>. \u306f\u3057\u308b means <code>run</code>. And we're going to leave out \u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3 for just a moment here. \u3064\u3065\u3051\u308b means to <code>continue</code>. So again we've got this form of taking the \u3044-stem of a verb, \u306f\u3057\u308b becomes \u306f\u3057\u308a and then we add onto it the verb \u3064\u3065\u3051\u308b (to continue). So \u300c\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u306f\u306f\u3057\u308a\u3064\u3065\u3051\u305f\u300dmeans <code>The rabbit continued running</code>. </p> <p>\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3 is something we're going to find very often in Japanese and that is, a doubled word that is a sound effect. There are lots and lots of these in Japanese, [e.g.] \u300c\u30b7\u30af\u30b7\u30af\u300d, which is the sound effect for crying. And some of them will be literal sounds and some of them describe states of various kinds. So we're going to be meeting a lot of these later. </p> <p>\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3 is almost a literal sound effect. It's the sound of a small thing jumping along, and you'll hear this an awful lot. I do at any rate, but then, a lot of my friends are small things that jump along. So \u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3 is the sound, or not quite a sound, it's... if it were an anime you'd probably hear the sound, wouldn't you, \u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u2026 \u2013 but in this case it's not necessarily a sound you hear, but it's the feeling, the sound-like feeling of a small thing, a small animal, jumping, jumping, little jumps. </p> <p>So, because it's a rabbit, it didn't run the way you run, it runs in a little jumping, bouncing fashion the way rabbits do. And the thing to note here is that we say \u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u30d4\u30e7\u30f3\u3068. So once again we're using that quotation particle. In this case we're using it to show how the rabbit ran, and because this is kind of technically a sound effect, we're <code>quoting</code> the sound the rabbit made in order to tell the manner in which the rabbit ran. It ran in a little-jumps kind of manner.</p> <p>All right. So next week we'll find out what happened.

Passive Conjugation / Receptive Helper Verb","text":"<p>Lesson 13: <code>Passive Conjugation</code> debunked: NOT passive. NOT a conjugation. IS easy.</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to talk about the receptive helper verb. In other places you will hear this referred to as the <code>passive conjugation</code>. Now, as we've already learned, there are no conjugations in Japanese, so it can't be a conjugation. </p> <p>::: info Again, Dolly says this to make it easier to understand, but if one would go into depths of linguistics it could be argued. I say this to show that there are a LOT of nuances as one goes deeper into a language and things are rarely simple and straightforward as you get past the basics, so one should keep this in mind. If you truly love reading, under this video, there\u2019s a VERY long, interesting discussion about this. :::</p> <p>But overall, there is no purely <code>right</code> or <code>wrong</code> really, just <code>more helpful</code> or <code>less helpful</code> for an individual.</p> <p>Also, it isn't passive. So that's zero out of two for the textbooks. And this matters because if we think of the receptive helper verb as a passive conjugation, it completely disrupts our grasp of the structure and, once again, it throws those poor particles all over the room. And as we know the particles are the linchpins, the hinges on which Japanese turns. So if we mess up the particles we are in deep trouble. And this is why so many people find Japanese hard to understand.</p> <p>::: details Just one of my rambling notes about the technicalities of terminology</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with calling it passive, you just need to keep in mind that it is different from the English passive, Dolly uses the term <code>receptive</code>, so this is her terminology she uses to avoid confusion in her model. In Japanese, it is referred to as \u53d7\u8eab\u5f62 - passive form, though Dolly goes off the first Kanji which can mean receive, so I see why and it is a good term too if anything.</p> <p>In basic terms, it could be said that the passive form in itself includes the receptive function as it is mostly used to put the Subject function onto the Patient (the receiver) of the action of the base verb (through \u308c\u308b) instead of the Agent (the doer of the action of the base verb), while Agent is usually marked by the \u306b in Passive, though there are more details which will be discussed, so Dolly\u2019s approach is fully valid too, but the term Passive works too in my opinion, though requires more linguistic base.</p> <p>Note that I am talking about the Syntax (Subject) vs Semantics (Patient/Agent) distinction.</p> <p>In grammar, things are rarely <code>black n\u2019 white</code>, so if it works for you, it\u2019s okay, just remember not to regard Japanese as if it were English! It is just using different words to express the same basic idea, so it is not important if Dolly\u2019s approach works well enough for a very basic understanding of grammar that can be fully grasped / corrected through lots of input.</p> <p>:::</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/13-passive-conjugation-receptive-helper-verb/#the-receptive-passive","title":"The Receptive / Passive","text":"<p>So, now I've mentioned <code>passive conjugation</code> just so you know what we're talking about if you find it in other contexts, let's drop those words completely and call it what it is: the receptive helper verb. </p> <p>So, what is the receptive helper verb? It's a verb that fits onto the \u3042-stem of another verb, and the \u3042-stem, that's the same stem that we use for attaching the -\u306a\u3044 negative helper adjective, isn't it? The receptive helper verb is \u300c\u308c\u308b\u30fb\u3089\u308c\u308b\u300d: that's \u308c\u308b for godan verbs, \u3089\u308c\u308b for ichidan verbs.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, a lot of people panic when they see that the \u3089\u308c\u308b of the ichidan receptive helper verb is the same as the \u3089\u308c\u308b of the ichidan potential helper verb. But there's no need to panic. It's perfectly all right. In English we have things like this as well. For example, we have the words <code>to</code>, <code>two</code> and <code>too</code>. And they're all pronounced the same and they're all very common words that are used hundreds of times every day. And how often do they get confused? Not very often at all. </p> <p>And it's the same with the potential and receptive helper verbs. They're used in quite different situations and there's very little chance of confusing them in real use. And real use is what matters. </p> <p>So, what does the receptive helper verb mean? It means <code>receive</code> or <code>get</code>. Receive what? Receive the action of the verb to which it is attached.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, most of the time I'm going to use the word <code>get</code> because this expresses very clearly what the helper verb does.</p> <p>::: info To be more clear, as Dolly says in the comments: </p> <p>So the <code>got</code> translation only works when English <code>got</code> means <code>receive (an action)</code>, not when it means <code>become (a state)</code>. Or to simplify the matter - you can use <code>got</code> to translate \u308c\u308b/\u3089\u308c\u308b but you can't always use \u308c\u308b/\u3089\u308c\u308b to translate <code>got</code>. :::</p> <p>Your old English teacher might say it's not the best way of expressing things, but it's a perfectly good way of expressing things in English and in Japanese it is exactly how we express them. All right?</p> <p>So, let's take a simple example: \u300c\u3055\u304f\u3089\u304c\u3057\u304b\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002\u300d </p> <p></p> <p>\u53f1\u308b/\u3057\u304b\u308b means <code>scold</code> or <code>tell off</code>, and the \u3042-stem is \u53f1\u3089, so when we add to that \u308c\u308b and put it into the past tense we get \u3057\u304b\u308c\u305f/\u53f1\u3089\u308c\u305f. \u53f1\u308b is <code>scold</code>, \u53f1\u3089\u308c\u308b is <code>get scolded</code>, \u53f1\u3089\u308c\u305f is <code>got scolded</code>, so, <code>Sakura got scolded</code>.</p> <p>Now, there's an important thing to bear in mind here, and that is that we can sometimes, with a helper verb attached to a verb, we can, as a sort of railroad shorthand, condense those two parts into one verb. </p> <p></p> <p>So we can say \u300c\u307b\u3093\u304c\u3088\u3081\u308b\u300d and although \u3088\u3081\u308b, which is the potential form of \u3088\u3080, is strictly speaking \u3088\u3081 plus \u308b, we can combine them together and treat \u3088\u3081\u308b as one engine. But we can't, and never should, do that with the receptive helper verb. Why not? Because when the receptive helper verb is attached to another verb, the action of the first verb is always done by someone different from the action of the second verb \u308c\u308b\u30fb\u3089\u308c\u308b.</p> <p></p> <p>So we always have in a receptive sentence the action that is done by someone else, whom we may or may not know, plus the real action of the sentence which is \u308c\u308b\u30fb\u3089\u308c\u308b, the receiving\u2014the getting\u2014of that action. And this is the fundamental point to bear in mind. It's because the textbooks don't keep this in mind and don't keep those two engines separate that all the confusion and difficulty over the so-called <code>passive conjugation</code> arises. The head verb of a \u308c\u308b\u30fb\u3089\u308c\u308b receptive sentence is always \u308c\u308b or \u3089\u308c\u308b, not the verb to which it is attached.</p> <p>Now, let's also notice that the A-car, the actor of the sentence, is not necessarily a person. So, if we say, \u300c\u6c34\u304c\u306e\u307e\u308c\u305f\u300d (\u306e\u3080/\u98f2\u3080\uff1ddrink; \u306e\u307e\uff1d \u3042 stem of drink; \u308c\u305f\uff1d got), we're saying <code>**The water** got drunk</code>. And the actor of that sentence is the water. </p> <p></p> <p>Now, even if we add a doer of the action: \u300c\u6c34\u304c\u3044\u306c\u306b\u306e\u307e\u308c\u305f\u300d, </p> <p></p> <p>the actor of the sentence is still the water, not the dog, because it's the water that got drunk, it's the water that did the getting. The dog did the drinking, but the water did the getting. And the dog drinking the water is all a white section which modifies that final head verb, <code>get</code>. <code>The water got drunk by the dog.</code></p> <p>Now, why do I mark the dog with \u306b? I'm going to come to that in just a moment. </p> <p>Let's get a fuller sentence so we can see all the particles working together in a receptive sentence: </p> <p>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u3060\u308c\u304b\u306b\u304b\u3070\u3093\u304c\u306c\u3059\u307e\u308c\u305f\u3002</p> <p></p> <p>(\u76d7\u3080/\u306c\u3059\u3080\uff1d steal; \u76d7\u307e\uff1d \u3042 stem of steal; \u76d7\u307e\u308c\u308b\uff1d get stolen; \u76d7\u307e\u308c\u305f\uff1d got stolen). \u8ab0\u304b/\u3060\u308c\u304b means <code>someone</code> (\u8ab0\uff1d who, \u304b\uff1d question). Who was it? We don't know, no one in particular, but someone. \u8ab0\u304b\uff1dSomeone.</p> <p>So, what's going on here? Who is the receiver of the action? It's not Sakura, who's marked by \u306f. It's not someone, who's marked by \u306b. It's the <code>person</code> who's marked by \u304c, and that's the bag. The bag is what received that stealing, so the bag is the subject of the sentence. The bag is the one who did \u308c\u308b, who did <code>got</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And \u306b... what's it doing here? Well, let's remember that \u306b marks the ultimate target of an action (\u3060\u308c\u304b). So, \u300c(zero\u304c)\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306b\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u306a\u3052\u305f\u3002\u300d the \u304c marked actor is I, the object of the action is \u30dc\u30fc\u30eb, and the target of that action is Sakura. (The non-receptive use of the \u306b)</p> <p></p> <p>Now, this kind of \u306b can only be used when we are projecting something, whether it's throwing a ball, sending a letter, giving a present, lending a book. We have to be projecting something toward the target.</p> <p>Now, \u308c\u308b is not a projecting verb. It's a receiving verb. It's not a push-verb, it's a pull-verb. </p> <p></p> <p>Therefore, the target of that verb is not something toward which you are projecting; it is the thing from which you are receiving. So \u306b performs the same function in relation to a pull-verb that it performs in relation to a push-verb, that is, the ultimate target of the push, the ultimate source of the pull. </p> <p>::: info This may be helpful. From the comments like this under the video. My understanding of this would be too long again, so I will not include it here, it is not needed here since I think Dolly explained it clearly enough and I do not want to put more headings here...*</p> <p></p> <p> :::</p> <p>So you see, all the particles are doing exactly what they always do. Nothing is changing here.</p> <p>::: info Well, as shown above, in the Passive/Receptive it sort of changes in that they reverse their polarity. Hence why \u306b is not <code>to</code> - receiver/<code>target</code> like in Active, but is now <code>by</code> - the doer, and \u304c instead is the receiver of the base action (\u306c\u3059\u3080) via \u308c\u308b. It can especially be explained via Semantic/Thematic Roles.* :::</p> <p>If you think of it as <code>passive conjugation</code>, all the particles do a strange dance and seem to be doing different things from what they usually do, but if you understand it as it is - the receptive helper verb - there isn't any problem.

Actor should mean Subject for Dolly but even that is just my guess based on when she uses it since she does not seem to explain what she really means by it, in one comment chain under this video she even calls Receptive \u306b as <code>secondary actor</code> (which is more akin to the actual linguistic Actor\u2026or Macrorole of Agent there) which does not help. :::</p> <p>::: details VERY optional <code>Explanation</code> Note &amp; example of my chronic rambling (or whatever lol)</p> <p>This is just one of my usual linguistic ramblings that do not really matter in the grand scheme of things &amp; are here for especially my own linguistic interest (or those who want to go more in-depth) I am just testing/practicing how I understand stuff with this in the general sense of linguistics.</p> <p>MY KNOWLEDGE IS VERY LIMITED, SO IT IS JUST ME EXPERIMENTING WITH A HYPOTHESIS. I AM VERY AWARE WHAT I SAY MIGHT BE OUTRIGHT WRONG!</p> <p>Dolly obviously does not use the terms as rigidly as I will here, because it is just basic grammar so it obviously has no need to be here anyway, but for the sake of it, I will have some linguistic fun:)</p> <p>Grammar is complex, so I still have things to learn and whatnot so I will also use this to research.</p> <p>If still unclear, to my understanding, it can be explained through Semantic roles/Thematic relations.</p> <p>Mind that Syntax / Syntactic and Semantics / Semantic are two different fields and one Syntactic function (Subject etc.) can have multiple Semantic roles, especially in terms of Active vs Passive/Receptive. It is because this is Passive/Receptive, \u304b\u3070\u3093 has the SYNTACTIC function of the SUBJECT (hence \u304c marked) BUT it has the same SEMANTIC function of the PATIENT - it received the act of the (verbs) stealing/being stolen by someone. In Active voice \u304b\u3070\u3093 has the SYNTACTIC function of the DIRECT OBJECT but still would have the SEMANTIC function of the PATIENT.</p> <p>Thus, if we were to have \u304b\u3070\u3093 marked by \u3092 (Direct Object - Syntactic function), it would have to be in the Active voice (since in Passive, we tend to put the Direct Object as the Subject instead) OR, as will be shown below, it would have to be in the form of a <code>Nuisance Receptive</code> as a secondary Object connected to a secondary Verb that adds <code>description</code> info about the main part. The term Actor that Dolly uses SHOULD mean the same as Agent as said *here* and *here* from what I found, but Dolly seems to use it here for Subject, in a way Actor should imply the one that does the action of the main verb, so I am confused what Actor means for her here, but it might be that\u2026 in which case, I get what Dolly means, tho she might be here merging the Syntactic and Semantic functions, else I misunderstood what she is implying by Actor here, since she seems to point it to the Subject which is a SYNTACTIC property, while Actor (or rather Agent) is a SEMANTIC property and in this sentence, in the comment she calls \u304b\u3070\u3093 <code>actor</code>, \u304b\u3070\u3093 should be the Patient, not <code>actor</code> as it receives the action, not doing the action of the main verb. That is to say if Actor is indeed like Agent.</p> <p>To be real, the term Actor I have seen used only rarely and it should imply Semantic function, BUT it can be used to refer to the <code>Semantic Macrorole</code> for Subject in the Active voice and by-phrase in the Passive (while Patient is the Direct Object in the Active and the Subject in the Passive, whose Macrorole is called <code>Undergoer</code>), as given here in the paper by a linguist Robert Van Valin\u2026[1] (page 1 &amp; 3) and it points to the relationship between Semantics and Syntax. Usually Agent (or its sub-names) are used, so it greatly confused me, but from other lessons, Dolly seems to refer to Subject as the Actor sometimes and uses them interchangeably even in the Passive/Receptive, so just keep that in mind that by Actor she means Subject even if it should refer to different things in the Passive from what I PERSONALLY researched\u2026 Furthermore this seems to be the case in Japanese too, as it is what IMABI seems to say in the Passive lesson, granted only using the term Agent, in Passive being marked by \u306b / \u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066. In ACTIVE voice these two SEMANTIC functions are generally SYNTACTICALLY expressed through Subject (Agent) and Direct Object (Patient), but they refer to different fields. In the Passive/Receptive, Patient is instead mostly put into the SYNTACTIC role of the Subject. Their SEMANTIC roles do not change - Patient &amp; Agent are still the same words, but their SYNTACTIC functions are changed, where Patient now becomes the Subject and Agent is put into the by-phrase, in this case \u306b-marked phrase. In Passive/Receptive there are 2 verbs - \u306c\u3059\u3080 and \u308c\u308b, \u306c\u3059\u3080 describes \u308c\u308b here, \u308c\u308b works as a Predicate?

It's not just like <code>enter</code>; it tends to be to <code>put into</code>, to <code>force into</code>, to do an action into something.

So \u3082 marks the topic of the sentence just the way \u306f does.

We would be saying, <code>The rabbit jumped into the rabbit-hole. As for Alice, she returned to her sister</code>. And you see that in English too. This has the implication that what Alice did was different from what the rabbit did. <code>The rabbit jumped into the rabbit-hole. As for Alice, she went back to her sister.</code> This is what \u306f does.</p> <p>If we'd used \u304c: \u300c\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u304c\u304a\u59c9\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306e\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306b\u623b\u3063\u305f\u300d, we'd simply have been saying, <code>The rabbit jumped into the rabbit-hole and **Alice** went back to her sister.</code></p> <p>::: info Alice = subject of its clause here, marked by \u304c. ::: But with \u306f, we are drawing that distinction; we are saying, <code>The rabbit jumped into the rabbit-hole, but as for Alice, she went back to her sister.</code> </p> <p>Now, if we say \u3082 instead of \u306f, then we are making the opposite point: we are saying that the comment we made on the rabbit is the same as the comment we're making on Alice. </p> <p></p> <p><code>The rabbit jumped into the rabbit-hole and Alice **also** jumped into the rabbit-hole.</code> </p> <p>So, there are various uses of \u3082, which we'll look at later, but this is the most fundamental one.

Transitive/intransitive verbs unlocked</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to look at self-move and other-move words.</p> <p>If you look in a standard Japanese textbook or dictionary,</p> <p>you usually see these defined as <code>transitive</code> and <code>intransitive</code> verbs.</p> <p>Now, this isn't as far off as some of the things you find in these books, such as conjugation, which doesn't exist in Japanese; passive (there is no passive in Japanese).</p> <p>Transitivity and intransitivity does exist in Japanese and most of the time there is a big overlap between that and self-move and other-move verbs.</p> <p>However, it doesn't work all the time and it isn't exactly what is meant by self-move and other-move in Japanese.</p> <p>So, if you're familiar and comfortable with the Western terms <code>transitive</code> and <code>intransitive</code>, it doesn't hurt a lot if you use them, at least not most of the time.</p> <p>But if you're not familiar with them, don't try to learn them just for the sake of Japanese, because they're not really accurate.  </p> <p>::: info My guess is in regards to English, since a lot of verbs that are transitive in English are not in Japanese etc., basically it is better to regard the two as their own entities to avoid confusion. :::</p> <p>So what are self-move and other-move words?</p> <p>In Japanese, a move-word, <code> \u52d5\u8a5e (doushi)</code>, is a verb,</p> <p>a word that denotes an action or a movement.</p> <p>So a self-move word is any verb that moves itself. So if I stand up, that's a self-move action. I'm not moving something else, I'm moving myself.</p> <p>If I throw a ball, that's an other-move action. I'm not throwing myself, I'm throwing the ball. And really it's as simple as that.</p> <p>Now, Japanese has a lot of pairs of words \u2013 so we could say they're either two forms of the same word or two very closely related words \u2013 where we have a self-move and an other-move version.</p> <p>So, one very good example is <code>\u51fa\u308b(\u3067\u308b)</code> and <code>\u51fa\u3059(\u3060\u3059)</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>They both use the same kanji which means <code>come out</code>.</p> <p>The base form is <code>\u51fa\u308b(\u3067\u308b)</code> and that means simply <code>come out</code> or <code>emerge</code>, and that's the self-move version.</p> <p>The other-move version is <code>\u51fa\u3059(\u3060\u3059)</code> and that means <code>take out</code> or <code>bring out</code>: cause something to come out. / Take something out etc\u2026</p> <p>::: info Not to confuse the translation <code>cause something to</code> as denoting causative (Lesson 19), \u51fa\u3059 has its own <code>causative</code> form - \u51fa\u3055\u305b\u308b(\u3060\u3055\u305b\u308b) that denotes its causative form. Here, you are doing the action of moving something. You are not making someone else do it. ::: So in the first case whatever it is is moving itself; it's coming out; it's emerging.</p> <p>In the second case, the actor of the sentence, the actor of the verb, is bringing something else out or taking something else out.</p> <p>::: info so, just like transitive, other-move SEEMS to imply something to the grammar object, whereas intransitive/self-move verb has no direct object, since it describes/<code>moves</code> just itself. ::: Now, this is often very useful, because in many cases it gives us two distinct words that are easy to understand because they're closely related.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u8ca0\u3051\u308b (\u307e\u3051\u308b)</code> means <code>lose</code> \u2013 it doesn't mean lose an object or lose money, but lose a contest, lose a war, lose a battle, lose a game \u2013 be defeated, in other words.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u8ca0\u304b\u3059(\u307e\u304b\u3059)</code>, which is the other-move version of <code>\u8ca0\u3051\u308b (\u307e\u3051\u308b)</code>, means <code>defeat</code> \u2013 in other words, cause someone else to lose / defeat someone.</p> <p>So where we have two words in English, <code>lose</code> and <code>defeat</code>, in Japanese we have fundamentally the same word in its self-move and its other-move versions.</p> <p>So that's very useful \u2013 but not so useful if you don't understand how to form self-move</p> <p>and other-move versions of a word. If you look in the standard textbooks, most of the time they're going to tell you that you just have to learn all the self-move and all the other-move words separately. Sometimes they give you lists of self-move and other-move pairs \u2013 transitivity pairs, as they call them. But this isn't true and it isn't necessary.</p> <p>Most of the time we can tell which is a self-move word and which is an other-move word.</p> <p>There are a few very simple rules that cover most of the move-word pairs.</p> <p>And those rules are even easier if you understand the logic that underlies them.</p> <p>And that's what we're going to learn right now.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/15-transitive-intransitive-verbs/#_1","title":"\u3042\u308b \uff06 \u3059\u308b","text":"<p>The first thing to know is that there is, as it were, an Adam and Eve of self-move and</p> <p>other-move words, the mother and father of them all.

This is not an intransitive word.</p> <p>You can't just obey or follow in the abstract. You obey someone or you follow someone.

I recommend reading through all comments about this.</p> <p>In the video, Dolly-\u5148\u751f misspeaks here (as she admits in the comments), calling \u898b\u3048\u308b <code>be able to see</code>, which might confuse someone to think of the potential form \u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b instead.</p> <p>In this case, she meant \u898b\u3048\u308b as the self-move version of \u898b\u308b, meaning something like <code>be visible/seeable</code> as physical visibility (of a thing etc.). It is a nuanced difference to \u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b. As Dolly says in the comments, it CAN both function as a potential and self-move version of</p> <p>\u898b\u308b. It\u2019s a different verb to \u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b, but \u898b\u3048\u308b can also function as the irregular potential form of \u898b\u308b and is also the self-moving partner to \u898b\u308b. Check lesson 54 for this, even right after.</p> <p>Also, this point (if you check \u898b\u3048\u308b inflections on Jisho), just like with \u51fa\u6765\u308b note in Lesson 10. The point here is that while both imply potential, there is a difference, with <code>be able to see</code> translation being more reserved to the <code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> instead of \u898b\u3048\u308b, hence why this note. ::: And if we look at the trains here,</p> <p>we've got to have a \u304c marked subject in this second clause:</p> <p><code>\u4f55\u3082 (zero\u304c) \u898b\u3048\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>What is the zero in this case?</p> <p>If we're looking at it in English terms we might think it's Alice - <code>Alice couldn't see anything</code>.</p> <p>But in Japanese it will usually in fact be <code>\u4f55</code>, which is <code>a thing / something</code>.</p> <p><code>Nothing was able to be seen, nothing could be seen</code>,</p> <p>because usually with expressions like <code>\u898b\u3048\u308b / \u898b\u3048\u306a\u3044</code>, <code>\u805e\u3053\u3048\u308b / \u805e\u3053\u3048\u306a\u3044</code>,</p> <p><code>be able to see/do seeable</code> <code>be able to hear/do hearable</code> (+ their \u306a\u3044-form not hearable etc.) ::: info The <code>do seeable</code> is a rough translation of how Dolly might translate it to I guess show that it\u2019s a verb more per some of her comments as noted on the previous page\u2019s note. Another translation for \u898b\u3048\u308b as per Dolly - to be visible/<code>do seen</code>/be seen/do seeable/visible. While -\u306a\u3044, as its negative form is quite adjectival (see this). It doesn't really matter how it\u2019s translated, only if you wanted to be more technical as per Dolly\u2019s way of rough translation &amp; to more clearly show the difference between \u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b &amp; \u898b\u3048\u308b. Check lesson 54.* :::</p> <p>- we apply it not to the person who's able to see, but to the thing that's able to be seen.</p> <p>And of course we've covered this, haven't we, in our lesson on the potential.

Sometimes, you may see \u3060\u308d\u3046 called a volitional form of \u3067\u3042\u308b instead of \u3060. From my research, it seems that \u3067\u3042\u308b is just a more literary/older form of \u3060. Also do note that doubt/conjecture implication which \u3060\u308d\u3046 / \u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046 gives to a sentence. :::</p> <p><code>\u305d\u308c\u306f\u8d64\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046 / \u3060\u308d\u3046</code> \u2013 <code>That's probably red / I think it's red</code>;</p> <p><code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u304c\u304f\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046 / \u3060\u308d\u3046</code> \u2013 <code>I think Sakura's coming / Sakura's probably coming</code>.</p> <p>::: info Even though \u3060\u308d\u3046 is a volitional form of the \u3060 copula, it actually seems like it can be used with adjectives normally, whereas regular \u3060 copula cannot.

It's logical and super easy</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002 Today we are going to talk about the causative helper verb.</p> <p>In the standard grammars this is called <code>causative</code> and it's a perfectly good name because it indicates that we are causing someone to do the verb to which it is attached.</p> <p>In the standard grammars it's often taught along with the receptive</p> <p>(which they like to call the <code>passive</code>) and there's a very very good reason for doing this although the real reason is never actually explained in the regular textbooks. So, I'll be telling you that shortly.</p> <p>But first of all let's look at what the causative helper verb is.</p> <p>It's a helper verb which, like the receptive, goes onto the end of the \u3042-stem of another verb, and while the receptive helper is <code>\u308c\u308b/</code>\u3089\u308c\u308b<code></code>, the causative helper is <code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>If they sound rather close to each other, there's a good reason for that.</p> <p>As we have noted earlier, the Eve and Adam of Japanese verbs are</p> <p><code>\u3042\u308b</code> and <code>\u3059\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>be</code> and <code>do</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3042\u308b</code> is the mother of all self-move verbs; <code>\u3059\u308b</code> is the father of all other-move verbs.</p> <p>Now, the receptive <code>\u308c\u308b/</code>\u3089\u308c\u308b<code></code> is closely related to <code>\u3042\u308b</code>;</p> <p>the causative <code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code> is closely related to <code>\u3059\u308b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And while it's not exact to say that they are the self-move and other-move versions</p> <p>of each other, we can see that they are very closely related conceptually to that.</p> <p><code>\u308c\u308b/</code>\u3089\u308c\u308b<code></code> indicates receiving the action to which it is attached.</p> <p><code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code> means causing that action to be performed by somebody else.</p> <p>And this leads on to the most fundamental similarity between the two pairs of helper verbs \u2013</p> <p>the similarity that the textbooks never explain and that is most fundamental to understanding how they work.</p> <p>Why don't the textbooks explain it?</p> <p>Well, the fundamental reason is that they call the causative and the receptive helper verbs <code>conjugations</code>.</p> <p>And the real structure of how they work is completely destroyed and obscured by calling them <code>conjugations</code>.</p> <p>A conjugated verb is by definition a single verb.</p> <p>But a verb plus the receptive or the causative helper is never a single verb.</p> <p>It's two verbs.</p> <p></p> <p>Not only is it two verbs, but the two verbs always have two separate subjects.</p> <p>So in a sentence like <code>\u6c34\u304c\u72ac\u306b\u98f2\u307e\u308c\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>the water got drunk by the dog</code></p> <p>\u2013 we have two verbs, two actions, and two different actors doing the two different verbs.</p> <p></p> <p>The main verb of the sentence, the core verb, is <code>\u308c\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>get</code></p> <p>\u2013 and that's being done by the water: the water is getting drunk by the dog.</p> <p>The secondary verb is <code>drink</code> and that's being done by the dog.</p> <p>This becomes clearer in a slightly longer sentence:</p> <p><code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u304c\u3060\u308c\u304b\u306b\u304b\u3070\u3093\u3092\u306c\u3059\u307e\u308c\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>Sakura got her bag stolen by someone</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Again, there are two actions going on, and always in a receptive sentence the main action, the core action of the sentence, is <code>\u308c\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>receive</code>: <code>Sakura received</code>.</p> <p>But there is a nested action within this done by the secondary verb, <code>\u306c\u3059\u3080</code> \u2013 <code>steal</code>.</p> <p>And that's done by <code>someone</code>.</p> <p>Now, it's exactly the same with the causative.</p> <p>We always have two actors performing the two different verbs.</p> <p>So if we say, <code> (zero\u304c) \u72ac\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u305f</code>, which means <code>I caused the dog to eat</code>,</p> <p>there are two actions going on.</p> <p></p> <p>There is the action of eating, which is being done by the dog, and then there is the main action, the core action of the sentence, the action of causing, which is done by me.</p> <p>So as you see, we cannot possibly talk about a conjugated verb in the case of either the</p> <p>receptive or the causative helper.</p> <p>In each case, there are two separate verbs.</p> <p>Even though they're joined together, they not only remain separate in function but</p> <p>they refer to two different actors.</p> <p>Now let's also take a moment to understand what <code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code> actually means.</p> <p></p> <p>We're told that in English it can mean either <code>make</code> someone do something or</p> <p><code>allow</code> someone to do something.</p> <p>And that's correct: it can have either of those meanings.</p> <p>But the important thing to understand is that it can have either of those meanings but</p> <p>it can also have neither of those meanings.</p> <p>The best way to translate it is with the very un-English sounding <code>cause</code> someone to do something.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>Because we can mean that we're forcing them to do something, we can mean that we are allowing them to do something, but we can also mean something that isn't covered by either of those English translations.</p> <p>An example?</p> <p>Well, you've already had one: <code> (zero\u304c) \u72ac\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u305f</code></p> <p></p> <p>It doesn't mean <code>I forced the dog to eat</code>, does it?</p> <p>But it also doesn't mean <code>I allowed the dog to eat</code>.</p> <p>It doesn't mean that I gave the dog permission to eat or I took it off its chain so it could reach the food.</p> <p>That's not what it means.</p> <p>It means that I set up the conditions under which it was able to eat; I gave it food;</p> <p>I caused it to eat.</p> <p>So <code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code> means <code>cause</code> a person or a thing to perform an action by whatever means, whether that causing is allowing, whether it's compelling or whether it's setting up the conditions to make it happen.</p> <p>Now, the only thing that can appear to be a little confusing about the causative is</p> <p>that sometimes the person or thing that we are causing to do something can be marked</p> <p>by \u3092 and sometimes by \u306b.</p> <p>Now, I've told you before that Japanese particles do not change their function at random, as the textbooks strongly imply and sometimes openly state that they do \u2013 and as we have to believe if we think that <code>\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3060</code> (Coffee pleasing is) literally means <code>I like coffee</code>.</p> <p>And if you don't know what I'm talking about here, please watch the relevant video (Lesson 9), because this is absolutely crucial to understanding Japanese correctly.</p> <p>So how is it that two different logical particles can apply to the thing or person we are causing to do something?</p> <p></p> <p>That is to say, the noun associated with <code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code>.</p> <p>First of all, we have to understand that this thing can be seen as either the object or the target of the action (<code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code>) of the person or thing that is doing the causing.</p> <p>If we take that object or target to be human, it becomes a little clearer.</p> <p>If we treat the person as the object, we are assuming that they have no personal will in the matter; we are treating them literally as an object.</p> <p>So this is more appropriate when we are compelling someone to do something;</p> <p>if we treat them as a target, the implication is more mutual, we are treating them more as an equal and this goes more naturally with allowing rather than compelling.</p> <p>And I've talked about these degrees of mutuality between the particles \u3092, \u306b and \u3068 when</p> <p>dealing with people in a video which you may want to watch.</p> <p>However, the choice between \u306b and \u3092 is not the main, or an exact, indicator of whether</p> <p>we mean allowing or compelling when we use <code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code>.</p> <p>Why not?</p> <p>There are two reasons for this.</p> <p>The first, as we've already mentioned, is that saying that <code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code> either means</p> <p><code>compel</code> or <code>allow</code> is warping the meaning of the causative by trying to find exact English analogies, and there is no precise English analogy.</p> <p>On many occasions, as I demonstrated, it may mean neither <code>compel</code> nor <code>allow</code>.</p> <p>It's a sliding scale between the two; it's subtler and more graduated than that.</p> <p>Secondly, when the action that is being compelled itself has a \u3092-marked object</p> <p>\u2013 for example, <code> (zero\u304c) \u72ac\u306b\u8089\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>(I) caused the dog to eat meat</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>You can see the implied, subordinate sentence here is <code>\u72ac\u304c\u8089\u3092\u98df\u3079\u305f</code>.</p> <p>The meat is the object of the dog's action,</p> <p>and the dog is the thing I am causing to do that action.</p> <p>Now, in these kinds of sentences, Japanese does not allow us to use the \u3092-particle twice.</p> <p>Since there is an \u3092-particle attached to the meat which is being eaten by the dog \u2013</p> <p>in other words, that's the object of the inner, subordinate sentence \u2013</p> <p>we can't also use it on the dog itself who is the object or target of the causing.</p> <p>Why is that?</p> <p>Well, really this is partly stylistic, but largely a pragmatic strategy on the part of Japanese grammar.</p> <p>Not only does it sound awkward if you have two \u3092s in the sentence, it could, in some</p> <p>sentences, become ambiguous.</p> <p>We might end up with some doubt as to which \u3092 marked the object associated with</p> <p><code>\u98df\u3079\u308b</code> (or whatever the verb is) and which \u3092 is associated with <code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code>, the causing of the action.</p> <p>As it is, we always know that in a <code>\u305b\u308b/\u3055\u305b\u308b</code> sentence, a causative sentence,</p> <p>which also has an object of the action itself, that object will always be marked by \u3092,</p> <p>and the target or object of the causation, the thing be made to do something or allowed to do something or facilitated in doing something, will be marked by \u306b.</p> <p>Well, that I think is the most complicated aspect of the whole thing,</p> <p>and it's not really very difficult, is it?</p> <p>Now, the other thing that people do find particularly difficult is the causative receptive</p> <p>(what is called the <code>causative passive</code> and, when taught with the standard grammatical model,</p> <p>causes people to receive a great deal of confusion)</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/19-causative-causative-receptive/#causative-receptive-causative-passive","title":"Causative receptive / causative passive","text":"<p>Now, as a matter of fact, once we have understood what the causative and the receptive really</p> <p>are and really do, I don't think there's anything special about the causative receptive at all.</p> <p>We know that helper verbs are simply verbs.</p> <p>They attach to other verbs, but they are verbs in their own right.</p> <p>If we don't understand this, everything becomes very difficult.</p> <p>Now also, the main structural helper verbs, like the causative, the potential and the</p> <p>receptive, are ichidan verbs.</p> <p>So if we need to attach anything else to them, we simply do what we do with every other ichidan</p> <p>verb \u2013 we take off the -\u308b and attach whatever it is we're going to attach.</p> <p>So if we want to attach the receptive to the causative, we simply take the -\u308b off the</p> <p>causative, <code>\u305b\u308b</code> or <code>\u3055\u305b\u308b</code>, and attach <code>\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>, which is the ichidan helper form</p> <p>of the receptive.</p> <p></p> <p>And it's as simple as that.</p> <p>Nothing complicated about it at all.</p> <p>But somebody's going to say, quite rightly,</p> <p><code>But don't we have three verbs in the sentence now?</code> and that's exactly right.</p> <p>We have three verbs in a causative receptive sentence.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u79c1\u306f\u30d6\u30ed\u30b3\u30ea\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u3089\u308c\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>I got made to eat broccoli</code>.</p> <p>So we have three verbs: <code>\u98df\u3079\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>eat</code>;</p> <p><code>\u3055\u305b\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>compel</code> (in this case it will be <code>compel</code>);</p> <p><code>\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>receive</code>: <code>I received being compelled to eat broccoli</code>.</p> <p>So, if we have three verbs, do we have three subjects?</p> <p>No, we have two subjects.</p> <p>There are always two subjects.</p> <p></p> <p>::: info In the video, the red <code>Secondary action: verb</code> has a typo <code>\u3055\u3089\u308b</code>.

The Invisible Carriage and the \u3092 Particle","text":"<p>Lesson 2: Core Secrets. Japanese made easy - unlocking the <code>code</code>. Learn Japanese from scratch</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/2-the-invisible-carriage-and-the-%E3%82%92-particle/#the-invisible-carriage","title":"The Invisible Carriage","text":"<p>In the last lesson, we learned that every Japanese sentence has the same core: the main carriage and the engine, also known as A and B, also known as the thing we are talking about and the thing we are saying about it. And I told you that we can have a lot more carriages as sentences become more complex, but they still always have the same core.</p> <p>Now we are going to look at some of those extra carriages. Previously, I stated that while every sentence has the same two core elements, you can't always see both of them. You can always see the engine, but sometimes you can't see the main carriage. Why not? When you can't see the main carriage, it's been replaced by the invisible carriage.</p> <p>So, what is the invisible carriage? In English, the closest equivalent is <code>it</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Let's begin by seeing what <code>it</code> does in English. Let's look at this example:</p> <p>The ball rolled down the hill.</p> <p>When the ball got to the bottom, the ball hit a sharp stone.</p> <p>The ball was punctured and all the air came out of the ball.</p> <p>Now, would anybody ever say this? Of course they wouldn't, because once we have established what we are talking about, we replace it with <code>it</code>. Instead we say,</p> <p>The ball rolled down the hill.</p> <p>When it got to the bottom, it hit a sharp stone.</p> <p>It was punctured and all the air came out of it.</p> <p><code>It</code> means nothing because it can mean absolutely anything. If I say <code>it</code>, I may be talking about a flower or about the sky. I may be talking about a tree, or my finger, or the Eiffel Tower or the Andromeda galaxy. <code>It</code> in itself doesn't mean anything: you know what <code>it</code> is from context.</p> <p>Now, let's suppose a small child tries to say this and says,</p> <p>Ball rolled down hill,</p> <p>got to bottom, hit sharp stone,</p> <p>got punctured, all the air came out.</p> <p>Now, is that difficult to understand? No, it isn't difficult at all, is it? Because in fact we don't need to use <code>it</code> every time, over and over again, to understand what's being said. While English grammar demands we do, but there's no actual communicative need to include <code>it</code> everytime.</p> <p>Japanese doesn't have <code>it</code>. (I guess what is meant is in the substituting sense as above)</p> <p>So, if a small child, or even an adult, comes down to the kitchen at night and someone sees her, she might say, <code>Got really hungry. Came for something to eat.</code> Again, there's nothing confusing or difficult about this. She means, <code>I got really hungry. I came down for something to eat.</code></p> <p>In English this isn't a proper sentence, but in Japanese it is. All those little pronouns, like <code>it</code>, <code>she</code>, <code>he</code>, <code>I</code>, <code>they</code>, in Japanese can be replaced by the invisible carriage, the zero pronoun. But the important thing to remember is that they are still there.</p> <p>So let's look at this at work in Japanese. I might say, <code>\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u3060</code>, and that means <code>I am Dolly</code>. Initially this looks as if it only has an engine and no main carriage, but actually the main carriage is simply the invisible carriage. The full sentence is really, <code>(zero\u304c)\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u3060</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>We can say that <code>I</code> is the default value of the zero pronoun, the invisible carriage. However, the context can define it as anything. For example, if we hear a rustling in the woods and look over in the direction of it, and I say, <code>\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u3060!</code>, that means <code>(zero\u304c)\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u3060!</code> <code>It is a rabbit!</code> It, that thing we just looked toward, rustling in the trees, that's a rabbit.</p> <p></p> <p>If I say, <code>\u571f\u66dc\u65e5\u3060</code> (\u571f\u66dc\u65e5/\u3069\u3088\u3046\u3073 means Saturday), I'm saying <code>(It) is Saturday</code>. What's <code>it</code>? Today is. All these sentences are full, complete Japanese sentences, with a \u304c-marked subject/ A carriage/main carriage, and an engine.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/2-the-invisible-carriage-and-the-%E3%82%92-particle/#the-particle","title":"The \u3092 particle","text":"<p>I'm going to introduce you to one more kind of carriage and that is an \u3092 car. This means a noun marked by the particle \u3092, pronounced <code>o</code>. And if you know the English grammatical term <code>object</code>, which means the thing we're doing something to, it's a good mnemonic to remember that <code>o</code> stands for <code>object</code>.</p> <p>So the \u3092 car looks like this, and as you see, it's white. It's white because it's not part of the core train. The core train always consists of just two elements, the engine and the main carriage. When we see white cars, we know that they're telling us something more about the engine or about the main carriage.</p> <p></p> <p>So let's take a sentence here: <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u304c\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u98df\u3079\u308b</code>. This means <code>I eat cake</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, the core sentence here is <code>I eat</code>. Those are the two black carriages. The white carriage, <code>\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092</code>, is telling us more about the engine. The core sentence is <code>I eat</code> and <code>\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092</code> is telling us what it is that I eat.</p> <p>Now, the interesting thing here is that we may often see this said like this: <code>\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u305f\u3079\u308b</code>. And you already know what's going on when this happens. This is another case where we have the invisible A car.</p> <p></p> <p>We can't have a sentence without a \u304c. We can't have an action being done without a doer. If we say <code>\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u305f\u3079\u308b</code>, what we're really saying is <code>(zero\u304c)\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u305f\u3079\u308b</code>. And the default value for <code>zero</code>, for the invisible carriage, is <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057</code>. So usually this is going to be <code>I eat cake</code>, although if you were talking about someone else at the time, it might mean that that person eats cake.</p> <p>::: info Just in case - as can be seen from from the pictures, every particle attaches to/assigns itself to the word BEFORE it, Not after it. :::</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/20-directionals-%E3%81%9D%E3%82%8C-%E3%81%9D%E3%81%AE-%E3%81%9D%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA-%E3%81%9D%E3%81%86-etc/","title":"20.

And this is true in many cases.</p> <p>It's probably the nearest you can get in English. But what it actually means is putting the action in place.</p> <p>And to understand this let's go back to our example</p> <p><code>\u7a93\u304c\u958b\u3051\u3066\u3042\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>the window is open because somebody opened it</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, the somebody who opened it, if we say it instead of from the point of view of the window, from the point of view of the person doing the action, \ud83d\udc47</p> <p><code>\u958b\u3051\u3066\u304a\u304f</code> is the other side of this.</p> <p></p> <p>The person put the opening of the window into place so that thereafter the window would be open.</p> <p>So you see we have the two halves of the same coin.</p> <p><code>\u7a93\u304c\u958b\u3051\u3066\u3042\u308b</code> \u2013 the window stands open because somebody put it there.</p> <p><code>\u7a93\u3092\u958b\u3051\u3066\u304a\u304f</code> \u2013 open a window so that it will stand open for the future, so that</p> <p>it will then be open, put into place the action of opening the window.</p> <p>And this is what <code>\u304a\u304f</code> means \u2013 <code>\u304a\u304f</code> means <code>place</code>.</p> <p>So you're <code>placing</code> the action, you're putting it into place, you're setting it up.</p> <p>And that's why it tends to have the secondary meaning of <code>do in advance</code> or <code>do for another purpose</code>, because you are setting up that action and the implication is that you want the effect of that action to <code>remain in place</code> for whatever future purposes it may have.</p> <p>In this case, Alice does not have a future purpose.</p> <p>So in fact, \u3066-form plus <code>\u304a\u304f</code> has a much wider range of meaning than</p> <p>the <code>do in advance</code> or <code>do for a purpose</code> kind of English translation that it gets in the textbooks.</p> <p>In the case of Alice in this story, she isn't really doing anything in advance or for a purpose; she's simply trying to solve the problem of what to do with the empty marmalade jar without risking injuring the people below.</p> <p>And there are many cases when this usage falls even further from the English-language definitions.</p> <p>For example, people say, <code>It's cruel to lock (up) a small child in her room</code>,</p> <p>and for this we use</p> <p><code>\u9589\u3058\u8fbc\u3081\u3066\u304a\u304f</code>.</p> <p><code>\u9589\u3058\u8fbc\u3081\u308b</code> is <code>shut someone up/lock someone away</code></p> <p>and the <code>-\u3066\u304a\u304f</code> here doesn't mean do it for a purpose, it doesn't mean do it in advance.</p> <p>It means do the action and leave its results in place/put the action in place and leave it in effect.</p> <p>Similarly, people say, <code>It's all right to leave a baby to cry sometimes</code> \u2013 <code>\u6ce3\u304b\u305b\u3066\u304a\u304f</code>.</p> <p><code>\u6ce3\u304f</code> is <code>cry</code>; <code>\u6ce3\u304b\u305b\u308b</code> is the causative of cry: <code>allow to cry</code> in this case.

This is not logically what's happening.</p> <p>And it's one of those things that makes it sound like a random rule when it isn't.</p> <p>What we are attaching <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> to is a completed action.</p> <p>And what we are saying is how long ago it happened.</p> <p>We're saying it happened a very very short time ago.</p> <p>So we have to have a completed action and of course it has to be in the past, because</p> <p>that's what we're saying about it.</p> <p>If it were in the non-past it wouldn't make any sense, would it?</p> <p>So we can say it attaches to the plain past of the verb or we can say it attaches exactly</p> <p>where it logically has to attach and where it would make no sense if it didn't.</p> <p>Now, the next use of <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> is one that people sometimes find confusing because it</p> <p>expresses that there is a great deal of something.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> obviously is a limiting word, so why is it used to express that there is</p> <p>a great deal of something?</p> <p>Now, once again, this is perfectly logical and natural and we use it in English as well.</p> <p>If we say <code>There are nothing but cakes in that shop!</code> - now, we may mean it literally,</p> <p>but very often we mean there are other things, but there are an awful lot of cakes.</p> <p>When I was staying in the countryside in Japan and I was moving to Tokyo for a while, somebody I knew there thought it was a bad idea for me to move to Tokyo and said, <code>\u6771\u4eac\u306f\u5916\u4eba\u3070\u304b\u308a\u3060</code> -</p> <p><code>In Tokyo there's nothing but foreigners.</code></p> <p>Now of course this person did not mean that there was nothing but foreigners in Tokyo;</p> <p>he meant that there are a lot of foreigners in Tokyo - and he knows that I don't want</p> <p>to be associating with foreigners who are going to start talking English at me.</p> <p>(It's all right - I avoided that.)</p> <p>So this is just a very obvious, natural use of <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a</code>.</p> <p>Now, we can extend this further by saying that someone is doing something a lot or is doing it continuously.</p> <p>Again, the textbooks give you these two meanings and make it sound a little complicated, but</p> <p>there's nothing complicated about it.</p> <p>It's very easy to understand from context.</p> <p>The way we do it is that we put <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> after the \u3066-form of the verb.</p> <p></p> <p>So, if you've ever heard <code>\u72ac\u306e\u304a\u307e\u308f\u308a\u3055\u3093</code>, which is a charming children's song about</p> <p>a lost kitten: <code>\u307e\u3044\u3054\u306e\u307e\u3044\u3054\u306e\u3053\u306d\u3053\u3061\u3083\u3093</code> -</p> <p>I'll put a link below so you can listen to it if you would like to.</p> <p>Now, when the dog policeman (<code>\u72ac\u306e\u304a\u307e\u308f\u308a\u3055\u3093</code>) asks the kitten what her name is and where</p> <p>she lives, the song says <code>\u306a\u3044\u3066\u3070\u304b\u308a\u3044\u308b\u3053\u306d\u3053\u3061\u3083\u3093</code>.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u306a\u3044\u3066\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> means <code>doing nothing but cry</code>.</p> <p>That's what it literally means, and in this case it means it quite literally.</p> <p>She did nothing but cry.</p> <p>She went on crying and she didn't answer, she didn't say what her name was or where she lived.</p> <p>And that's where we get the idea of continuing to do something.</p> <p>You don't stop doing it, you don't do anything else, you go on doing it: <code>\u3057\u3066\u3070\u304b\u308a</code>.</p> <p>It can also be used figuratively.</p> <p>You can say that somebody does nothing but play golf.  </p> <p>$&amp;</p> <p>Now, in this case it's a hyperbole, isn't it?</p> <p>Nobody does nothing but play golf.</p> <p>Everybody sometimes eats, sometimes sleeps, and occasionally plays <code>Captain Toad</code>, because everybody plays <code>Captain Toad</code> sometimes.</p> <p>So we have a hyperbole.</p> <p>We're not saying that someone continues doing something and doesn't do anything else.</p> <p>We're saying that they do it an awful lot.</p> <p>It's a simple enough hyperbole and exactly the same hyperbole that we would have in English:</p> <p><code>She does nothing but play Nintendo</code>.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> can also be used to make two conjunctions.</p> <p>Conjunctions, as we know, are things that connect together two complete logical clauses</p> <p>in a compound sentence.</p> <p>So we can say <code>\u3046\u305f\u3063\u305f\u3070\u304b\u308a\u304b\u3001\u304a\u3069\u3063\u305f</code> - <code>she didn't just sing, she also danced</code>.</p> <p>Now, the only thing you really have to understand here is the use of <code>\u304b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u304b</code>, as we know, is the question marker and, as we discussed last week, it can turn a statement</p> <p>into a hypothesis, a question for discussion.</p> <p>But it can also do another thing and that is it can, especially in colloquial usage,</p> <p>throw things into the negative.</p> <p>And we have the same in English, don't we?</p> <p>When we ask a question in order to show a negative.</p> <p>We can say <code>Do you think I'm going to do that?</code></p> <p>meaning <code>I'm not going to do that.</code></p> <p>And it's the same with <code>\u304b</code> in Japanese: in some cases we put <code>\u304b</code> after something to say it isn't the case.</p> <p>So if we say <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> we're saying <code>only that is the case</code> and if we say <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a\u304b</code> we're</p> <p>saying <code>not only that is the case</code>.</p> <p>The other common conjunction we make with <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> is <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a\u306b</code>.</p> <p><code>\u306b</code> can sometimes be added to something in order to make a conjunction.</p> <p>We've seen this with <code>\u306e\u306b</code> and I made a video about this a while ago</p> <p>which you may want to watch.</p> <p><code>\u3070\u304b\u308a\u306b</code> is an explanatory conjunction.</p> <p>We're saying that something happened and then we're putting a <code>because</code> at the end of it and saying it was because something else happened.</p> <p>The most usual explanatory conjunctions are <code>\u304b\u3089</code> or <code>\u306e\u3067</code>, but <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a\u306b</code> has a special implication.</p> <p>It's not just saying that something happened because of something, it's saying that it</p> <p>happened JUST because of something.</p> <p>Again we can liken <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> to English <code>just</code>.</p> <p><code>\u8033\u304c\u5927\u304d\u3044\u3070\u304b\u308a\u306b\u3001 \u8ab0\u3082\u904a\u3093\u3067\u304f\u308c\u306a\u3044</code> - <code>Just because my ears are big, no one will play with me.</code></p> <p></p> <p>The textbooks will perhaps caution you here that <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a\u306b</code> doesn't necessarily mean</p> <p>this conjunction, and that's true.</p> <p>But understanding it from context is simple because we all know that a conjunction can</p> <p>only sit at the end of a complete logical clause that's followed by another logical clause.</p> <p>If <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a\u306b</code> is not at the end of a logical clause then it's not the conjunction, and</p> <p>if it's in the middle of a sentence, which it normally will be, it must make sense to put a comma after it.</p> <p>Because all conjunctions must logically be able to take a comma after them.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/28-%E3%82%88%E3%81%86%E3%81%AB-one-key-to-all-the-main-uses/","title":"28. \u3088\u3046\u306b -

the logical clause becomes the adjectival, the descriptor, for that noun, so we know that any verb-engine together with the logical clause it heads can become an adjectival so we're not saying <code>\u306e\u3088\u3046</code>, we're NOT saying the likeness of something else here.</p> <p>So when we have a logical clause plus <code>\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b</code>, we're saying that something became</p> <p>or entered the state of being or the form of that logical clause.</p> <p>So, for example, if we say <code>\u5f7c\u3092\u4fe1\u3058\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f</code>, we're saying <code>I came to believe him.</code></p> <p></p> <p><code>\u5f7c\u3092\u4fe1\u3058\u308b</code> (or <code>zero\u304c\u5f7c\u3092\u4fe1\u3058\u308b</code>) --<code>I believe him</code> -- is a logical clause,</p> <p>and we're saying that I moved into the state, I became the state of that logical clause:</p> <p><code>I came to believe him.</code></p> <p>This is often used with a potential helper verb.</p> <p>For example, we might say, <code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306e\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f</code> --</p> <p><code>Japanese manga became readable (to me)</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>As you see, in both cases something is changing its state.</p> <p>I change my state from not believing him to believing him;

Some of you who have done some Japanese already may be wondering how I've managed to get through two entire lessons without using or even mentioning the \u306f (always read as wa) particle. I'm well aware that most courses start you on \u306f from the beginning. <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3060</code> <code>\u30da\u30f3\u306f\u3042\u304a\u3044.</code> And this is really a very very bad idea because it leaves you completely unclear about what the particles really do and about the logical structure of sentences.</p> <p>However, we're now ready to look at the \u306f particle and find out what it does and, just as important, what it doesn't do. The \u306f particle can never be a part of the core sentence. It can never be one of the black carriages, the main car A (the thing we are saying something about) or the engine B (the thing we are saying about it).</p> <p></p> <p>It can't be a white car either, because white cars like the \u3092 (wo) car, are part of the logical structure of the sentence.</p> <p></p> <p>And a \u306f-marked noun is never part of the logical structure of a sentence. \u306f is a non-logical particle.</p> <p>So if \u306f is not a black car or a white car, what kind of a carriage is it? Well, it's not a carriage at all. A \u306f-marked noun looks like this\u2026</p> <p></p> <p>That's right, it's a flag. Why do we depict it as a flag? Because that is what \u306f does. It flags something as the topic of the sentence. It doesn't say anything about it. That's what the logical sentence is there for. Wa simply flags the topic.</p> <p>Now, some of the textbooks will tell you that a sentence like <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3060</code> literally means <code>As for me, I am an American</code>, and that is exactly correct. If they would stick with that logic and carry it through, we wouldn't have the trouble we have.</p> <p>So, <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057/\u79c1\u306f</code> means <code>as for me</code>. <code>\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3060</code> means <code>=American</code> or <code>am American</code>. So as you see, with a sentence like this something is missing, both from the Japanese and the English. We can't say <code>as for me, am American</code>. Neither can we have a sentence without an A car, without a \u304c-marked doer. So if we put the A car in, it makes sense in both English and Japanese.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u79c1\u306f(zero\u304c)\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3060</code> \u2013 <code>As for me, (I) am an American.</code></p> <p>Now, some of you may be saying, \"Isn't it over-complicated? Can't we just pretend that \u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f is the main car of the sentence?\" And the answer to that is <code>No</code>. Because although it works in this case and some other cases, it doesn't work in every case and that is why we really mustn't do it.</p> <p>Let's take an example. There's an old joke among Japanese learners and it's only possible because of how badly Japanese is taught. The joke is: A group of people are dining in a restaurant and they're discussing what they're going to eat, and somebody says, <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u3046\u306a\u304e\u3060</code>. Unagi/\u3046\u306a\u304e means eel, so the joke is that this person has literally said, <code>I am an eel</code>.</p> <p>After all, if <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3060</code> means <code>I am an American</code>, then <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u3046\u306a\u304e\u3060</code> must mean <code>I am an eel</code>. That's absolutely perfect logic \u2013 except that <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3060</code> doesn't mean <code>I am an American</code>. It means <code>As for me, I am an American</code>.</p> <p>As we know, the default value of the invisible car, the zero pronoun, is <code>\u79c1/\u308f\u305f\u3057</code>, but that isn't its only value. Its value depends on context.</p> <p>In <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3060</code> (<code>As for me, I am an American</code>) the value of the zero pronoun is indeed <code>\u79c1/\u308f\u305f\u3057</code>. But in <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u3046\u306a\u304e\u3060</code>, which is <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f(zero\u304c)\u3046\u306a\u304e\u3060</code>, zero is not <code>\u79c1</code>. Zero is <code>it</code>. <code>It</code> is the thing we are talking about, the subject of the conversation: what we are eating for dinner.</p> <p></p> <p>And this is going to affect all kinds of sentences as we become more advanced in Japanese. So what we are going to do now is take another one of the cars and look at that and then see how it all works together with \u306f.</p> <p>The car we're going to introduce today is a white car, and this is the \u306b (ni) car. It makes a kind of trio with \u304c (ga) and \u3092 (wo). In <code>A does B</code> sentences, \u304c tells us who does the doing, \u3092 tells us what it is done to, and \u306b tells us the ultimate target of that doing. Now, we don't always have a \u3092; we don't always have a \u306b.</p> <p></p> <p>But let's take this \u3092 sentence: <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u304c\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u306a\u3052\u308b</code></p> <p>\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb is ball and \u306a\u3052\u308b means throw. So this is, <code>I throw a ball</code>. The core sentence is <code>I throw</code> \u2013 <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u304c\u306a\u3052\u308b</code>, and the white car tells us what I threw: it was a ball.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, if we say, <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u304c\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306b\u306a\u3052\u308b</code>, this means <code>I throw a ball at Sakura</code> (or <code>to Sakura</code>). Sakura is the destination, the target, of my throwing.</p> <p></p> <p>And it's very important to note here that it is the logical particles \u2013 \u304c, \u3092 and \u306b \u2013 that tell us what is happening. The order of the words doesn't really matter the way it does in English. What matters is the logical particle.</p> <p>So if I say, <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306b\u3055\u304f\u3089\u304c\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u306a\u3052\u308b</code>, I'm saying, <code>Sakura throws the ball at me</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>If I say, <code>\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306b\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3092\u306a\u3052\u308b</code>, I'm saying, <code>The ball throws Sakura at me</code>. It doesn't make any sense, but we might want to say it in a fantasy novel or something.</p> <p></p> <p>We can say whatever we like in Japanese so long as we have the logic of the particles correct. But now let's introduce \u306f into this sentence: <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306b\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u306a\u3052\u308b.</code> This is <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f(zero\u304c)\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306b\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u306a\u3052\u308b</code>. As we know, what it means is <code>As for me, I throw the ball at Sakura</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now let's give the \u306f to the ball: <code>\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u79c1\u304c\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306b(zero\u3092)\u306a\u3052\u308b</code>. What we are saying now is <code>As for the ball, I throw it at Sakura</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>The important thing to notice here is that when we change a logical particle from one noun to another we change what's actually happening in the sentence, but when we change the non-logical particle \u306f from one noun to another \u2013 I can change it from me to the ball \u2013 it makes no difference to the logic of the sentence. It makes a difference to the emphasis: I'm now talking about the ball, <code>as for the ball...</code></p> <p>What happens to the ball is that I throw it at Sakura, but who is doing what, and what they are doing it with and what they are doing it to, none of that changes when you change the \u306f particle and that's the difference between a logical and a non-logical particle.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/30-japanese-conditionals-%E3%81%A8/","title":"30. Japanese Conditionals: \u3068","text":"<p>Lesson 30: Japanese conditionals: \u3068TO. What the textbooks don't tell you.</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to start talking about Japanese conditionals.</p> <p>Conditionals are when you say something like <code>If...</code> or <code>When...</code></p> <p>And in Japanese there are a number of different conditionals,</p> <p>and this can cause some confusion to learners.</p> <p>Which one do we use, and when, and why?</p> <p>As usual, we tend to get a list of these things from the text-books with complicated instructions,</p> <p>and as usual it helps a great deal if we can understand the underlying logic.</p> <p>So, this lesson we're going to start with the conditional \u3068.</p> <p>Now, we've already met this \u3068.</p> <p>It is the <code>exclusive and</code> particle.</p> <p>I'm not talking about Boolean logic here.</p> <p>I'm talking about the fact that Japanese has two words for <code>and</code> which are used to connect two nouns.</p> <p></p> <p>One is \u3084, and \u3084 is the same as English <code>and</code>.</p> <p>It means one thing <code>and</code> another <code>and</code> possibly other things too.</p> <p>If we say <code>hat and coat</code>, we may well have on shoes and skirt and pants and other things too, but we just say <code>hat and coat</code>.</p> <p>In Japanese, if we say <code>\u30da\u30f3\u3084\u672c</code> \u2013 <code>pen and book</code> \u2013 we're saying, just like English <code>and</code>,</p> <p><code>a pen and a book and maybe some other things and maybe not</code>.</p> <p>But if we say <code>\u30da\u30f3\u3068\u672c</code>, that is exclusive.</p> <p>We're saying <code>pen and book and nothing else</code>.</p> <p>Now, this is important to understand because this is exactly the same \u3068 that we use as a conditional.</p> <p>The textbooks tend to introduce this \u3068 as if it were something different from the <code>and</code> \u3068,</p> <p>but it's not \u2013 it's the same.</p> <p>There is another \u3068 and that is the quotation particle which we've covered at some length</p> <p>in more than one lesson. That is separate from the <code>and</code> \u3068.</p> <p>But the conditional \u3068 is not: it's the same \u3068.</p> <p>And when we understand that, it becomes much easier to see what's going on with this particular conditional.</p> <p>Now, one more thing we need to know is that this \u3068 is a particle, but it's not a logical particle. And it's not a non-logical particle either.</p> <p></p> <p>What do I mean by this?</p> <p>Well, a logical particle is a particle that marks the case of a noun.</p> <p>Now, you don't need to know what that means \u2013 it's not important to get that theoretical knowledge.</p> <p>What it means is, in plain English, that it tells us what the noun is doing in the sentence</p> <p>in relation to other nouns and in relation to the verb.</p> <p>The \u304c particle tells us that the noun is being or doing something; the \u3092 particle tells us</p> <p>that it is having something done to it; the \u306b particle tells us that it is a target.</p> <p></p> <p>So what logical particles do is tell us who is doing what to whom and where and when.</p> <p>Non-logical particles \u306f and \u3082 mark the topic, which is not a logical construction.</p> <p>They tell us what noun we're talking about but they don't tell us what part it plays in the sentence.</p> <p>Now the point about logical particles is that they must attach to nouns.</p> <p>They can't do anything other than attach to a noun.</p> <p>And this is obvious, because that's their function \u2013 to tell us what role a noun plays in a sentence.</p> <p>\u3068 is not a logical particle and therefore, while it can attach to nouns,</p> <p>it can also attach to a logical clause and that's what allows it to be a conditional.</p> <p>All right. So now we know enough to go ahead.</p> <p>If I say, <code>\u51ac\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3068\u5bd2\u304f\u306a\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>When it becomes winter (or, if it becomes winter) it gets cold.</code></p> <p>So why is this connected with the <code>exclusive and</code> function of \u3068?</p> <p>It is connected with it because what we are saying is that only one possibility exists,</p> <p>only one result can follow from what we're talking about.</p> <p>If winter comes, it will get cold \u2013 there's no other possibility.</p> <p>If rain falls, the ground will get wet \u2013 there's no other possibility.</p> <p>It can also be used in a hyperbolic fashion.</p> <p>We've talked about hyperboles before, haven't we?</p> <p>This is where you say something that exceeds the truth.</p> <p>And human language does this all the time.</p> <p>So, someone might say <code>\u305d\u308c\u3092\u98df\u3079\u308b\u3068\u75c5\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>If you eat that, you will get sick.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, this is not like winter coming and it getting cold or the rain falling and the ground getting wet.</p> <p>It's possible that you might eat it and not get sick, but this is a hyperbole.</p> <p>What you are trying to say to someone is <code>If you eat that, you will get sick</code>.</p> <p><code>If you keep playing those games, you'll fail the exam.</code></p> <p>Now again, it's possible that the person might keep playing the games and still get through the exam, but the hyperbole is <code>Do A and B will happen</code>.</p> <p><code>Keep playing those games and you'll fail the exam.</code></p> <p><code>Eat that and you'll get sick.</code></p> <p>We are putting something forward as an inevitable result, an exclusive result,</p> <p>a result to which no other alternative exists.</p> <p>Now, we can also use this \u3068 to mean that something is necessary.</p> <p>We can say <code>\u884c\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3068\u30c0\u30e1</code> \u2013 <code>If I don't go, it will be bad.</code> ::: info \u3060\u3081 is in katakana, usually it\u2019s done for style, to spot words better in-text/avoid confusion or for emphasis of it, maybe to give it more emotional force or such. ::: <code>\u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3068\u884c\u3051\u306a\u3044</code> \u2013 literally, <code>If I don't study, it can't go</code></p> <p>but what that means is <code>If I don't study, it won't be good</code> (<code>...it won't do</code>, as we might say in English).</p> <p>And what it actually means is <code>I must study / I've got to study</code>.</p> <p>And very often you'll hear this just on its own.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u9003\u3052\u306a\u3044\u3068!</code> And that just means, literally <code>We don't run and...</code></p> <p>That's to say, <code>If we don't run...</code></p> <p>And the implication here is that if we don't run, something bad will happen.</p> <p>So if in an anime somebody says, <code>\u9003\u3052\u306a\u3044\u3068!</code> they're really just saying <code>Run! / We must run.</code></p> <p>And in this sense, \u3068, because it is so absolute, because it is so exclusive,</p> <p>is stronger and a little more colloquial than similar uses like \u3070/\u308c\u3070.</p> <p>And we'll talk about the \u3070/\u308c\u3070 construction next time.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/31-the-%E3%81%B0-%E3%82%8C%E3%81%B0-conditional/","title":"31.

What it really means and how to use it easily.</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to talk about the conditional \u3070/\u308c\u3070.</p> <p>Last week we looked at the \u3068 conditional and we saw that its particular characteristic</p> <p>was its exclusiveness, its implication that only one outcome is possible.</p> <p>In many cases we can use any or most of the conditionals without changing the meaning</p> <p>to any great extent, but each conditional has its own particular qualities.</p> <p>So today we're going to look at the special quality of</p> <p>\u3070/\u308c\u3070 and some of the things it does and why it does them.</p> <p>First of all, what is \u3070/\u308c\u3070?</p> <p>\u3070/\u308c\u3070 is a helper which we put on to the \u3048-stem of a verb.</p> <p></p> <p>The \u3048-stem is one of the lesser used stems but \u3070/\u308c\u3070 is one of the things that uses it.</p> <p>So, for godan verbs we put it on to the \u3048-stem and for ichidan verbs, as always, we simply put it on to ... we simply take off the -\u308b and add the ichidan form, -\u308c\u3070.</p> <p>For the two irregular verbs, in this case they work exactly like regular ichidan verbs.</p> <p>So <code>\u6765\u308b</code> becomes <code>\u6765\u308c\u3070</code> and <code>\u3059\u308b</code> becomes <code>\u3059\u308c\u3070</code>.</p> <p>Actually, <code>\u6765\u308b</code> and <code>\u3059\u308b</code>, I would say, are in fact ichidan verbs, but they're strong ichidan verbs. A strong verb is a verb that can change its vowel sound.</p> <p>In English we have <code>come</code> and <code>came</code>, <code>eat and </code>ate\".</p> <p>And <code>\u6765\u308b</code> and <code>\u3059\u308b</code> in some cases change their vowel sound.</p> <p><code>\u6765\u308b</code> in the negative becomes <code>\u3053\u306a\u3044</code>, <code>\u3059\u308b</code> becomes <code>\u3057\u306a\u3044</code>.</p> <p>But in this case they don't change their vowel sound at all, so that's very simple --</p> <p>they just work like the ichidan verbs that they fundamentally are.</p> <p>For adjectives, we take off the -\u3044 and use the helper -\u3051\u308c\u3070.</p> <p></p> <p>You might notice that when we do anything with an adjective other than simply</p> <p>take off the -\u3044 and add whatever we're going to add, the specific adjectival modifications</p> <p>all come from the \u304b-\u304d-\u304f-\u3051-\u3053 row.\u3000</p> <p>So, the negative of an adjective is -\u304f\u306a\u3044 (<code>\u9762\u767d\u3044</code> --&gt; <code>\u9762\u767d\u304f\u306a\u3044</code>);</p> <p>the past is -katta (<code>\u9762\u767d\u3044</code> --&gt; <code>\u9762\u767d\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>);</p> <p>and the \u3070 conditional is -\u3051\u308c\u3070 (<code>\u9762\u767d\u3044</code> --&gt; <code>\u9762\u767d\u3051\u308c\u3070</code>).</p> <p>So in a way we could say that if adjectives had an \u3048-stem, it would be -\u3051.</p> <p>And that's what we use in that case.</p> <p>So what's the special characteristic of \u3070/\u308c\u3070?</p> <p>-\u3068, as we know, its special characteristic is its exclusiveness.</p> <p>The special characteristic of \u3070/\u308c\u3070 is that it is used for hypotheticals. So it must always mean <code>if</code>.</p> <p>It can't ever mean <code>when</code>, because we never know for sure if the condition will take place and consequently if we use it about something that happened in the past it has to be something that didn't happen because if it did happen we wouldn't be dealing with a hypothesis, we'd be dealing with a fact.</p> <p>Now this hypothetical nature of \u3070/\u308c\u3070 allows it to be used in many common</p> <p>and very important Japanese expressions.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u3069\u3046\u3059\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3044</code>.</p> <p>What this literally means is <code>how, if I act, will be good</code>.</p> <p>And I'll just note here that while <code>\u3059\u308b</code> is generally translated as <code>do</code>, in many cases</p> <p>the best way to render it into English is as <code>act</code>.</p> <p>So, for example, if we say <code>\u9759\u304b\u306b\u3059\u308b</code>, we're not saying <code>do quietly</code>, we're saying <code>act quietly</code>.</p> <p>So, <code>\u3069\u3046\u3059\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3044</code> -- <code>how, if I act, will be good</code>.</p> <p>And in English what we'd normally say is <code>What should I do?</code></p> <p>But in Japanese we don't say that.</p> <p>As we'll see, this is partly because the concept of <code>should</code> isn't quite the same in Japanese, and \u3070/\u308c\u3070 is often used to solve the problem.</p> <p>We'll come back to that in a moment.</p> <p>Another common use of \u3070/\u308c\u3070 is in <code>\u3059\u308c\u3070\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u304b\u3055\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308c\u3070\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p>In English we would say <code>I should have brought an umbrella</code>.</p> <p>What we're actually saying here is <code>If I had brought an umbrella, it would have been good</code>.</p> <p><code>\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b</code>, as I've explained elsewhere, we join the word <code>carry</code> and the word <code>come</code></p> <p>to mean <code>bring</code> (<code>carry-to-here</code>) and we notice that <code>\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> throws it into the past tense.</p> <p>As you know, in Japanese, we mark the past tense at the end of a logical clause.</p> <p>So even though it may be true that if it's raining right now, if I had brought an umbrella</p> <p>it would have been good and it still would be good,</p> <p>we throw the whole thing into the past tense with that final <code>\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p><code>\u304b\u3055\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308c\u3070\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> --</p> <p><code>I should have brought an umbrella / I wish I had brought an umbrella.</code></p> <p>Now notice that in both these cases, <code>\u3069\u3046\u3059\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3044</code> / <code>\u304b\u3055\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308c\u3070\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>,</p> <p>we are using this <code>if it were done, it would be good</code> to mean <code>should</code>.</p> <p>And this happens again in an even commoner Japanese construction.</p> <p><code>\u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044</code> -- <code>If I don't study, it won't go / it won't do.</code></p> <p>Now what we are actually saying here is <code>I must study</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>There actually isn't a word for <code>must</code> in Japanese, so we always construct it this way.</p> <p>We say <code>If I don't... (whatever it is)</code></p> <p>and then we can say <code>it won't be good / it will be bad / it'll be a disaster...</code></p> <p>Whatever we say, some negative construction then follows this, and what we're saying is</p> <p><code>I must go / I've got to go / I've got to do this / I've got to do that</code>, and this is because</p> <p>we don't have that construction <code>got to</code> and we don't have <code>must</code> in Japanese.</p> <p>It always has this rather lengthy \"If I don't do, it won't be good / if I don't do, it won't do /</p> <p>If I don't do, it's bad<code> -- </code>\u7121\u3051\u308c\u3070 / \u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u30c0\u30e1\".</p> <p>And because it is indeed a very long-winded way of saying something common like <code>must</code> or <code>got to</code>,</p> <p>it often gets cut down in casual speech to just <code>\u3057\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070</code> or even <code>\u3057\u306a\u304d\u3083</code>,</p> <p>which is short for <code>\u3057\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070</code>, without adding the negative ending, because that's just implied.</p> <p>However, even in very casual speech it's often said in full,</p> <p>and I think this is to emphasize the nature of the <code>must</code>.</p> <p><code>\u306a\u305c\u884c\u304b\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044?</code> -- <code>Why have I got to come/go?</code> ::: info if it helps, more literally something like <code>Why if (I) don\u2019t go, (it\u2019s) bad/it won\u2019t do?</code> Or as Dolly-\u5148\u751f says in the comments for \u884c\u304b\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044 + what that \u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044 means: :::  *</p> <p>In cases like that, where we're putting stress on it as opposed to cases where</p> <p>we're just saying casually <code>\u884c\u304b\u306a\u304d\u3083</code> -- <code>I've got to go</code>. ::: info literally maybe <code>If (I) don\u2019t go\u2026</code>, negative afterwards is just implied/unvoiced ::: So this is the special characteristic of \u3070/\u308c\u3070, that it's dealing with hypotheticals.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/32-the-%E3%81%9F%E3%82%89-%E3%81%AA%E3%82%89-conditionals/","title":"32.

Powerful analysis technique.</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we are going to discuss the most fundamental thing in Japanese.</p> <p>And, if we understand this, we can understand any Japanese sentence.</p> <p>If we don't, we can't.</p> <p>It's really as fundamental as that.</p> <p>And I introduced this in our very first lesson, because if we don't have this, we're going nowhere.</p> <p>What we are going to do today is start talking about how we can apply this to any Japanese</p> <p>sentence that we find in the wild.</p> <p>Now, the fundamental core of Japanese, as you know, is the core Japanese sentence.</p> <p>It's what I call the A-car and the B-engine.</p> <p>Both of those elements have to be there in every sentence.</p> <p>We can always see the B-engine.</p> <p>We can't always see the A-car, but it's always there.</p> <p>In English these are called the subject and the predicate and in Japanese they are called the \u4e3b\u8a9e/\u3057\u3085\u3054 and \u8ff0\u8a9e/\u3058\u3085\u3064\u3054,</p> <p>but we are going to continue calling them the A-car and the B-engine</p> <p>because this way we can visualize exactly what's going on in a sentence by using trains.</p> <p>Now this lesson begins with a question asked by my Gold Kokeshi patron Pantelis Chrysafis-sama (and I hope I'm pronouncing your name right).</p> <p>It was a very simple question, but a very good one, a very fundamental one.</p> <p>It was simply, <code>How do we know where a logical clause ends?</code></p> <p>And that's really the same as the question <code>How do we identify a logical clause?</code></p> <p>We need to know where it ends and we need to know where it begins.</p> <p>The factors complicating this are that there can be more than one logical clause in a compound sentence</p> <p>(but as I'm going to demonstrate, that isn't really as difficult as it seems)</p> <p>and also the fact that we can't always see the A-car.</p> <p></p> <p>The other complicating factor is the fact that we will see the elements of logical clauses</p> <p>and even complete logical clauses that are not part of the sentence core.</p> <p>And if they're not part of the sentence core, what they are doing is modifying or</p> <p>telling us more about either the A-car or the B-engine.</p> <p></p> <p>That's the only thing they can ever be doing, because the sentence is its core</p> <p>and everything else in the sentence is related to and telling us more about that core.</p> <p>Now, sentences where there is more than one logical clause have to be connected</p> <p>by some kind of conjunction.</p> <p>And this is very important, because this gives us the key to seeing whether or not there</p> <p>is more than one core and if there is, where they are and how they're working.</p> <p>In our recent series on conditionals, we were in fact dealing with conjunctions.</p> <p>There are various kinds of conjunction: and, but, when, if, etc.</p> <p></p> <p>And the two other kinds of conjunctions that we need to look out for are the \u3066-form, which can join two clauses together into a compound sentence, as we looked at in our first lesson on compound sentences (Lesson 11), and the \u3044-stem of a verb.</p> <p>You've seen how the \u3044-stem is the main conjunctive stem out of the four stems of verbs.</p> <p></p> <p>It can connect nouns to verbs; it can connect other verbs to verbs; it can connect various helpers to verbs; and it can also connect one logical clause to another.</p> <p>This is slightly more literary, slightly more sophisticated, perhaps, than the \u3066-form,</p> <p>but it's the one other thing you need to look out for when you're investigating whether</p> <p>there is more than one logical clause in a sentence.</p> <p>We'll talk about this more in a later lesson.</p> <p>Now, let's talk about the complications that can arise and how we can see through them,</p> <p>how we can use our detective powers to see what's really going on.</p> <p>I'm going to take a simple conditional sentence that we used before.</p> <p><code>\u304b\u3055\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u6765\u308c\u3070\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> which means \"I should have taken an umbrella /</p> <p>I wish I'd taken an umbrella\".</p> <p>What it literally means is <code>If I had taken an umbrella, it would have been good.</code></p> <p>Now, we can see the first logical clause easily, can't we?</p> <p>That is <code>\u304b\u3055\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u6765\u308c\u3070</code>, which is simply <code>\u304b\u3055\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b</code> -- <code>bring an umbrella</code></p> <p>-- turned into its conditional form -- <code>if I bring an umbrella</code> -- and that's going to</p> <p>be thrown into the past tense by the final engine in the sentence, which is the way Japanese works.</p> <p>So, we have clause one, which is <code>\u304b\u3055\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u6765\u308c\u3070</code>.</p> <p>We know that it's a complete clause and we know it's going to be followed by a second clause because we have a conjunction there in the form of a conditional.</p> <p>But what follows it is simply <code>\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> which is the past tense of <code>\u3044\u3044</code> and it means <code>good</code>.</p> <p>Is this a core sentence?</p> <p>Yes, it is.</p> <p>The first sentence is <code>\u304b\u3055\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308c\u3070</code> ; the second sentence is <code>(zero\u304c)\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p>We know this because <code>\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> is an engine.</p> <p></p> <p>It's an adjective, it's a describing word and it has to be describing something.</p> <p>Wherever you've got an adjective, the adjective must be describing something.</p> <p>Wherever you've got a B-engine, there must be an A-car to correspond to it.</p> <p>So what is the A-car here?</p> <p>What is <code>\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> describing?</p> <p>What is it telling us <code>would have been good</code>?</p> <p>This is a very important point.</p> <p>If we translate it into very literal English, what we're saying is \"If I had brought an umbrella,</p> <p>it would have been good.\"</p> <p>And this is exactly what the Japanese means.</p> <p><code>It</code> would have been good. The A-car is <code>it</code>.</p> <p>So what is <code>it</code>?</p> <p>This is the important point: <code>It</code>, or the zero-car, does not have to be clearly definable,</p> <p>either in English or in Japanese.</p> <p>What <code>it</code> means here is <code>the circumstance / things in general (would have been good)</code>.</p> <p>And we do this in Japanese all the time.</p> <p>And we do it in English all the time.</p> <p>So, for example, if we say in English <code>It's sunny, isn't it!</code></p> <p>In Japanese we might say <code>(zero\u304c)\u6674\u308c\u3060\u306d!</code></p> <p></p> <p>They mean the same thing.</p> <p>In English we have to say <code>It is sunny</code> -- we could say <code>Sunny, isn't it?</code> but that's only</p> <p>because we're leaving out the <code>it</code>.</p> <p>And we've still got it at the end, because we don't ever say <code>Sunny, isn't!</code></p> <p>We say <code>Sunny, isn't it!</code> which must be short for <code>It is sunny, isn't it!</code></p> <p>In Japanese we say <code>\u6674\u308c...</code> (which means <code>sunny</code> or <code>clear</code> in the sense of clear skies):</p> <p><code>\u6674\u308c\u3060\u306d!</code></p> <p>Now, <code>\u3060</code> is the copula.</p> <p>It's got to be connecting that <code>\u6674\u308c\u6674\u308c</code> to something else, which is our zero-particle.</p> <p>What is it connecting it to?</p> <p>Well, in this case we don't know.</p> <p>It could be the day -- <code>The day is sunny</code>.</p> <p>It could be the weather -- <code>The weather is sunny</code>.</p> <p>It could be the sky -- <code>The sky is clear</code> -- because <code>\u6674\u308c</code> can mean <code>clear</code> as well in that sky sense.</p> <p>It doesn't matter.</p> <p>It doesn't matter in Japanese and it doesn't matter in English what we mean by <code>it</code> when</p> <p>we say <code>If I'd brought an umbrella, it would have been good</code> or <code>It is sunny</code>.</p> <p>But we can't do without it.</p> <p>We can't do without it in Japanese and we can't do without it in English.</p> <p>Because in both Japanese and English we have to have an A-car and a B-engine.</p> <p>A subject and a predicate. A \u4e3b\u8a9e/\u3057\u3085\u3054 and a \u8ff0\u8a9e/\u3058\u3085\u3064\u3054.</p> <p>In English we always have to be able to see both of them.</p> <p>In Japanese we don't need to see the first one.</p> <p>We do need to see the second one.</p> <p>But the first one is always there, and if we don't understand that we're going to have</p> <p>great difficulty picking out the core sentence, especially as things get more complex.</p> <p></p> <p>So, to get directly to the question, how do we find the end of a logical clause?</p> <p>Now, the main logical clause, the head clause of the sentence, is always the last one,</p> <p>and we can find the end very easily because the end of the logical clause is the end of the sentence.</p> <p>In Japanese, a sentence has to end with an engine, that is to say, an adjective, a copula</p> <p>(<code>\u3060</code> or <code>\u3067\u3059</code>) or a verb.</p> <p>So the last engine in the sentence will be the end of the head clause of the sentence,</p> <p>the main final clause of the sentence, always.</p> <p></p> <p>It will be the last thing in the sentence apart, perhaps, from one or two sentence-ender</p> <p>particles like <code>\u3088</code> or <code>\u306d</code> or <code>\u3088\u306d</code>.</p> <p>We call them sentence-ender particles, but in a way it might be more accurate to call them</p> <p>particles that come after the end of the sentence.</p> <p>The final engine is the end of the logical sentence and the ender particles are just</p> <p>a little add-on that we put on right after the end of the sentence.</p> <p>So it's very easy to find the end of the last logical clause in a sentence or the end of</p> <p>the entire logical clause if there is only one logical clause in the sentence.</p> <p>The more difficult question -- but it's not really all that difficult, but the question</p> <p>that can cause problems is the question of how do we find or how do we eliminate the</p> <p>possibility of a compound sentence?</p> <p></p> <p>How do we know there are no other logical clauses in the sentence or, if there are,</p> <p>how do we find them?</p> <p>And the answer to that is again very simple and straightforward.</p> <p>A logical clause will always end with an engine: a verb, a noun followed by a copula (<code>\u3060</code></p> <p>-- it won't be followed by <code>\u306a</code>, because if the copula <code>\u3060</code> has become <code>\u306a</code> then</p> <p>it must be a modifier, it can't be a logical clause in itself) -- a noun with the copula <code>\u3060</code>,</p> <p>or an adjective.</p> <p>And if it is a clause before the final clause in a compound sentence, it's going to end</p> <p>with a connector.</p> <p>It has to, because it has to connect to the next logical clause.</p> <p>So, now what we're going to do is look at the sort of complex sentence that can confuse</p> <p>people and we're going to look at how we tackle that sentence.</p> <p>So the sentence is \"\u79c1\u304c\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306b\u8a71\u3057\u305f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u7559\u5b66\u751f\u306f (zero\u304c) </p> <p>\u4e94\u8f2a\u91d1\u30e1\u30c0\u30eb\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3057\u305f\u5973\u6027\u3068\u7d50\u5a5a\u3057\u305f\"</p> <p>Now, as you can see, that looks pretty complicated.</p> <p>How do we go about it, how do we go about analyzing it?</p> <p>Jay Rubin-\u5148\u751f, for whom I have great respect, suggests that if we're really stuck we should</p> <p>work backwards through a Japanese sentence.</p> <p>And there's some sense in that, because Japanese sentences do in a certain way and up to a</p> <p>certain point run in reverse order from an English sentence.</p> <p>However, we can only do that with written sentences.</p> <p>We can't do it with spoken sentences because people won't speak backwards for us most of the time.</p> <p>However, one thing I do think is useful if you're feeling particularly stuck with a sentence</p> <p>is to make sure you've got the head verb or the head copula or the head adjective,</p> <p>whatever is the head of the sentence, in your mind.</p> <p>So if we just take a peek at that first so we know where we're going to.</p> <p>And the head of this sentence is very straightforward, isn't it?</p> <p>It's <code>\u7d50\u5a5a\u3057\u305f</code>.</p> <p>The head verb is simply <code>\u3057\u305f</code> -- <code>did</code> -- but that's making a \u3059\u308b-verb with <code>\u7d50\u5a5a</code>; so, <code>\u7d50\u5a5a\u3057\u305f</code>.</p> <p>What the sentence is telling us is that somebody got married.</p> <p>All right.</p> <p>But now let's do what I think we should do so long as we can, and most of the time we really can --</p> <p>Start from the beginning. All right.</p> <p>So, the first part of the sentence, the first clause: <code>\u79c1\u304c\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306b\u8a71\u3057\u305f</code></p> <p>Now, that could be a complete logical sentence in itself, couldn't it?</p> <p><code>I spoke to Sakura.</code></p> <p>Or it could be <code>I told Sakura</code> in which case it couldn't be complete in itself, could it?</p> <p>Because I would have to tell her something.</p> <p>Now, which is it in this case?</p> <p>Well, we know that's it's not a complete logical clause, <code>I spoke to Sakura.</code> Why not?</p> <p>Because it's not ending in any kind of conjunction, is it?</p> <p>It's followed directly by a noun, <code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e</code>.</p> <p>There's no conjunctive word, there's no \u3066-form and it's not the \u3044-stem of <code>\u8a71\u3059</code>.</p> <p>So we know that this is in fact a modifier for something else.</p> <p>So, what have we got next?</p> <p><code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b</code> -- now, that means <code>Japanese is possible</code>.</p> <p>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\" could be a complete sentence in itself, couldn't it?</p> <p><code>To me, Japanese is possible.</code></p> <p>The <code>to me</code> would be implicit, but that's fine, we do that all the time.</p> <p>But we know it isn't because it doesn't end in any kind of conjunction.</p> <p>So this also can't be a complete logical clause within a compound sentence.</p> <p>It must be a modifier for something.</p> <p>And what we expect it to be a modifier for would be a person: a person to whom Japanese is possible.</p> <p>And that's exactly what we get next: <code>\u7559\u5b66\u751f</code>.</p> <p><code>\u7559\u5b66\u751f</code> is an exchange student, usually from a foreign country.</p> <p>So, <code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b</code> modifies <code>\u7559\u5b66\u751f</code> -- <code>an exchange student to whom Japanese is possible / a Japanese-speaking exchange student.</code></p> <p>And <code>\u79c1\u304c\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306b\u8a71\u3057\u305f</code> is modifying all that.</p> <p><code>The Japanese-speaking exchange student who I told Sakura about</code></p> <p>And then that's followed by \u306f.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u7559\u5b66\u751f\u306f</code> indicates it's very likely, isn't it, that this is going to be</p> <p>the topic of the sentence and that the topic of the sentence is going to be the doer,</p> <p>the A-car of the sentence.</p> <p>But let's continue the sentence and see if that seems to be the case.</p> <p>We now have <code>\u4e94\u8f2a\u91d1\u30e1\u30c0\u30eb</code> and that means an Olympic gold medal.</p> <p><code>\u4e94\u8f2a</code> means <code>five circles</code>.</p> <p><code>\u4e94\u8f2a\u91d1</code> -- which is gold -- <code>\u30e1\u30c0\u30eb</code> -- an Olympic gold medal -- <code>\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3057\u305f</code>.</p> <p>Now that is not, that can't be a logical sentence because it's not a logical sentence, is it?</p> <p>It's not a logical sentence without a doer, and there's no doer implied here.</p> <p>But we have the doer right afterwards, don't we?</p> <p></p> <p>So we know that we have here a modifier for another noun, not a logical sentence in itself:</p> <p><code>\u4e94\u8f2a\u91d1\u30e1\u30c0\u30eb\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3057\u305f\u5973\u6027</code>.</p> <p>So now we have another modified noun: <code>A woman who won an Olympic gold medal</code>.</p> <p>And now we've come to the head-verb of the sentence: <code>-\u3068\u7d50\u5a5a\u3057\u305f</code>. ::: info about that \u3068* ::: </p> <p>So we were right. (about the \u306f presumption)</p> <p>We have the A-car, which is the exchange student (in the sentence it would be more specifically the zero\u304c after <code>\u7559\u5b66\u751f\u306f</code> which implies said exchange student, that is the invisible subject, so subject is also the topic here) who can speak Japanese that I told Sakura about married (B car - predicate) a woman who won an Olympic gold medal.</p> <p>And as you see, we've got various actions going on in this sentence; we've got various</p> <p>things that could, under different circumstances, form logical clauses of their own, but</p> <p>none of them actually can.</p> <p>We now know that this is not a compound sentence.</p> <p>This is one rather complex sentence with a single A-car (zero\u304c = \u7559\u5b66\u751f) and a single B-engine (\u7d50\u5a5a\u3057\u305f).</p> <p>Where a logical clause ends is either at the end of the sentence or before a conjunction.</p> <p>And if you can do that, you can analyze just about any Japanese sentence, however complicated it looks, and see what's going on in the sentence.</p> <p>::: tip if still confusing, I recommend you read the comments under that video. With lots of input, the brain should sort it out eventually, but it needs work and time. Dolly just prepares for that dive. At this point, you might want to slowly start with input if you have not yet, together with Dolly grammar. Once finished with the transcript, refer to it when you encounter something confusing or want to review, but comprehensible input/<code>immersion</code> is the key (as Dolly herself advocated). This way, you will be ready to apply stuff in Lessons 45-48 right away. But it is up to you, it would be good to get the tools etc. ready now at least &amp; start after 45-ish. As mentioned on the first page, I have written a long document - LINK HERE - containing my most favourite sites that have hundreds of extremely useful and varied resources, tips, guides, tools and everything needed for deep Japanese immersion that you may find somewhat helpful. :::</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/35-%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A-%E3%81%AE%E3%81%BB%E3%81%86-%E4%B8%80%E6%96%B9/","title":"35. \u3088\u308a, \u306e\u307b\u3046, \u4e00\u65b9","text":"<p>Lesson 35: Yori, no hou, ippou- how they MAKE SENSE!</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to talk about <code>\u3088\u308a</code> and <code>\u307b\u3046</code>.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u3088\u308a</code> and <code>\u307b\u3046</code> are often introduced together in sentences like:</p> <p><code>\u30e1\u30a2\u30ea\u3088\u308a\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306e\u307b\u3046\u304c\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060.</code></p> <p>And that is a slightly verbose way of saying <code>Sakura is prettier than Mary</code>.</p> <p>I think this is an unfortunate way of introducing the two terms because it can easily give rise to confusion.</p> <p>It can be difficult to understand what term is doing what and how they relate to the rest of the sentence.</p> <p>It's much easier if we look at these two separate and independent terms,</p> <p>both important in its own right, separately, and then we can put them together.</p> <p>So let's start by looking at <code>\u3088\u308a</code>.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/35-%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A-%E3%81%AE%E3%81%BB%E3%81%86-%E4%B8%80%E6%96%B9/#_1","title":"\u3088\u308a","text":"<p>\u3088\u308a is a particle.</p> <p>It's not one of our logical particles, so it does not have to be attached to a noun.</p> <p>It can go after just about anything: a complete logical sentence, a noun, an adjective, a verb -- whatever we want.</p> <p>Its basic physical meaning is <code>from</code>.</p> <p>When we send a letter, we may say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3088\u308a</code> -- <code>from Sakura</code>.</p> <p>And abstract words all have their base in physical metaphors, even if we sometimes forget</p> <p>the physical metaphor, and with words like this, it's useful to begin by understanding</p> <p>the original literal meaning and then seeing how the metaphor works.</p> <p>So <code>yori</code> means <code>from</code>, and we already have another word meaning <code>from</code>, don't we?</p> <p>And that's <code>\u304b\u3089</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, there is a difference between the two, which is particularly pronounced as we start</p> <p>to apply them metaphorically.</p> <p><code>\u304b\u3089</code> marks the <code>A</code> in <code>A from B</code> in such a way that it is treating <code>A</code> as the starting point or point of origin.</p> <p>So, if I say <code>\u65e5\u672c\u304b\u3089\u6765\u307e\u3057\u305f</code>, I'm saying <code>I came (or come) from Japan / Japan is my point of origin.</code></p> <p>And this in a way is midway between the literal, physical meaning and the metaphorical meaning, because it can mean literally I just came on a plane from Japan or it can imply that</p> <p>I'm Japanese or that I was raised in Japan or something like that.</p> <p>When we move to its purely metaphorical meaning, it usually means <code>because</code>.</p> <p>In other words, <code>A</code> is the point of origin of <code>B</code>.</p> <p><code>\u5bd2\u3044\u304b\u3089\u30b3\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u7740\u308b</code> -- <code>Because (it's) cold, I wear a coat</code> /</p> <p><code>From the fact that (it's) cold, I'm wearing a coat.</code></p> <p>Now, <code>\u3088\u308a</code> means <code>from</code> in a very different sense.</p> <p>The directional metaphor is concentrating not on the origin of A from B, but in the</p> <p>distance or difference of A from B. So, if we say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u30e1\u30a2\u30ea\u3088\u308a\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060</code></p> <p>we're saying that <code>from Mary</code> Sakura is pretty.</p> <p></p> <p>What we mean by this is that distinguished from Mary, Sakura is pretty.</p> <p>Now, it does have something in common with <code>\u304b\u3089</code> because we're still using Mary as the base point, the point of comparison.</p> <p>And because of this, because it has a comparative meaning, we're not saying Sakura is pretty but Mary isn't.</p> <p>We're saying that, taking Mary as the point of comparison, Sakura is pretty -- therefore, more pretty, prettier.</p> <p>In comparison to Mary, going <code>from</code> Mary, Sakura is pretty.</p> <p>And you notice here that we said just what that first sentence,</p> <p><code>\u30e1\u30a2\u30ea\u3088\u308a\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306e\u307b\u3046\u304c\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060,</code> was saying and we didn't need <code>\u307b\u3046</code>.</p> <p>It works perfectly well to say exactly the same thing without that <code>\u307b\u3046</code>.</p> <p>And we use <code>\u3088\u308a</code> in other contexts.</p> <p>For example, we may say <code>\u4eca\u5e74\u306e\u51ac\u306f\u3044\u3064\u3082\u3088\u308a\u5bd2\u3044,</code> which literally means</p> <p><code>Comparing from always, this year's winter is cold</code> or <code>This year's winter is colder than always.</code></p> <p></p> <p>And what that actually means is <code>This year's winter is colder than usual, colder than most other years.</code></p> <p>So that <code>always</code> is a kind of hyperbole, in a way.</p> <p>Similarly, we can say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u4eba\u3088\u308a\u8ce2\u3044(\u304b\u3057\u3053\u3044)</code> -- <code>Sakura is clever compared to people.</code></p> <p>And what that means, again, is \"Sakura is clever compared to most people / Sakura is</p> <p>clever compared to people in general<code> -- in other words, is cleverer </code>than\" the average person.</p> <p>All right, so now let's look at

different.</p> <p>It's not a particle, it's a noun.</p> <p>That's why we have <code>\u306e\u307b\u3046</code>.</p> <p>And its literal meaning is a <code>direction</code> or a <code>side</code>.</p> <p>And when we say <code>side</code>, we mean <code>side</code> in the sense of <code>direction</code>, not in the sense of <code>edge</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So, for example, if we talk about two sides of a field with <code>\u307b\u3046</code>, we're not meaning the</p> <p>two edges of the field, we're meaning that we divide it approximately in half</p> <p>and we talk about <code>the left side</code> and <code>the right side</code> of the field.</p> <p>Now, as we see from this analogy, one side always implies the other side.</p> <p>And that's the important thing about <code>\u307b\u3046</code> in its metaphorical uses.</p> <p>In its literal use, when I'm cycling in Japan, I might say to a stranger,</p> <p>pointing in the direction I'm going in,

directions, which I can't understand in English, or Japanese,</p> <p>or any other language.</p> <p>I'm asking for the literal direction: <code>Is Honmachi that way, or am I going in the opposite direction?</code> \u2013 which I often am, because I am <code>\u65b9\u5411\u97f3\u75f4 / \u307b\u3046\u3053\u3046\u304a\u3093\u3061</code>, which means (I) have no sense of direction.</p> <p>So when we apply it metaphorically, we mean one thing or circumstance or whatever as opposed to another.</p> <p>We can put it after a noun with \u306e, as we do with Sakura: <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306e\u307b\u3046</code>, or we can put it after a verb or an adjective, in which case that verb or adjective is describing the <code>\u307b\u3046</code>, telling us what kind of a <code>\u307b\u3046</code> it is, which <code>side</code> it is.</p> <p>So, if you say to me <code>\u30e1\u30a2\u30ea\u304c\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3046?</code></p> <p>-- <code>Do you

words, I think Sakura is prettier.</p> <p></p> <p>Once again, it's a comparative construction, so I'm not saying Sakura is pretty and Mary isn't, but I am saying that the side of Sakura is prettier than the other side, which is Mary.</p> <p>And, once again, let's notice that we don't need <code>\u3088\u308a</code> here.</p> <p><code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306e\u307b\u3046\u304c\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060</code> works perfectly happily on its own to mean exactly the same thing.

it's future by default).</p> <p>If we say <code>\u663c\u3054\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3079\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3060</code>, what we're saying is <code>I'm just about to eat lunch.</code></p> <p>What's the structure of this?</p> <p>Well, it ends with <code>\u3060</code>, so we know that what we have is an <code>A is B</code> sentence, even though the original sentence sandwiched into it is an <code>A does B</code> sentence.</p> <p></p> <p>So we're saying that <code>(something) is place</code>.</p> <p>The zero-car here is <code>it</code>, as it would be in English, and what it means is the present time,</p> <p>exactly as it does in English when we say <code>It's time to leave</code> -- <code>the present time is time to leave</code>.</p> <p>The <code>it</code> is <code>the present time</code> in both Japanese and English in these constructions.</p> <p>So, we're saying <code>It (the present time) is I-will-eat-lunch time</code>, so what it means is</p> <p><code>I'm just about to eat lunch</code>.</p> <p>So how putting <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3060</code> onto this sentence changes it from what it would mean if we just</p> <p>said <code>\u663c\u3054\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3079\u308b</code> is that it's telling us that we are right now at that place where</p> <p>I'm going to eat lunch, therefore I'm just about to eat lunch.</p> <p>NOT <code>I'm going to eat lunch possibly in half-an-hour.</code></p> <p>I'm just about to eat lunch right now.</p> <p>This is the place where I'm just about to eat lunch.</p> <p><code>\u663c\u3054\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3079\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3060.</code></p> <p>Now, if we use it with the actual present, the continuous present, which is what we use</p> <p>when we're actually saying we're doing something right at this moment, so we say</p> <p><code>\u663c\u3054\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3060</code>, what we're saying is <code>I'm eating lunch right now.</code></p> <p>And just as with the previous example, what that <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3060</code> is doing is making it immediate.</p> <p>It's the difference in English between saying <code>I'm eating lunch</code> and <code>I'm eating lunch right now.</code></p> <p>Now, in the past, if we say <code>\u663c\u3054\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3060</code>, what we're saying is <code>I just ate lunch.</code></p> <p>The <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3060</code> is adding to that past tense the immediateness: \"The place in time that</p> <p>we're at now is the place where I ate lunch / I just ate lunch.\"</p> <p>Now, in this case we could say <code>\u663c\u3054\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> - <code>I just ate lunch.</code></p> <p>The two mean pretty much the same thing.</p> <p>And I've seen textbooks giving us this set of rules : \"You can use \u3070\u304b\u308a with a noun.</p> <p>You can say <code>\u3053\u306e\u304a\u5e97\u306f\u30d1\u30f3\u3070\u304b\u308a\u58f2\u308b</code> -- <code>This shop sells nothing but bread</code> -- or</p> <p>we can say <code>\u663c\u3054\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3070\u304b\u308a\u3060</code> -- <code>I just ate lunch.</code></p> <p>But you have to remember that the rules say that <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d</code> can't be used with a noun.\"</p> <p>Now, this is true, but it's a strangely abstract way of putting it.</p> <p>It's putting it as if these are just some random rules that somebody made up, perhaps</p> <p>in the Heian era because they had nothing better to do with their time.</p> <p>In fact, if we understand the logic of it, we don't even need to be told this, because it's obvious.</p> <p>I can say either <code>I just ate lunch</code> or I can say <code>I'm at the place where I've eaten lunch</code>.</p> <p>We can say <code>This shop just sells bread</code>, but <code>this shop bread place sells</code> doesn't make</p> <p>any sense at all, does it? (\u3042\u306e\u304a\u5e97\u306f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u58f2\u308b = wrong)</p> <p>And this is why I think it's so important to learn structure.</p> <p>People sometimes say to me \"Am I supposed to be working out all this structure you teach</p> <p>in every sentence I speak or read?\"</p> <p>And of course the answer to that is <code>No</code>.</p> <p>What you're supposed to be doing is getting used to Japanese by reading, listening, and</p> <p>preferably speaking too. (=The importance of immersion stated right here (\u0e51\u02c3\u0335\u1d17\u02c2\u0335))</p> <p>If you're not doing that, you'll never get used to the grammar however many textbooks you study.</p> <p>But if you understand the structure you won't be confused by things like whether you can</p> <p>use <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d</code> with a noun or not, and why can't you use <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d</code> with a noun when you can use <code>\u3070\u304b\u308a</code> with a noun, and you have to think all that out.</p> <p>You don't have to do that because you understand how it's actually working.</p> <p>This is what the textbooks could usefully be teaching, but they don't.</p> <p>Now, having learned the structure, it's also important to be aware of the times when bits</p> <p>of the structure can get left off.</p> <p>As with many regular set expressions, the copula <code>\u3060</code> can be left off, and</p> <p>more than this, even the end of <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d</code> can be left off.</p> <p>The <code>\u308d</code> can be left off and we can just say <code>\u3068\u3053</code>.</p> <p>This is the case in all languages, that there are places where, colloquially, we can leave bits out.</p> <p>And so long as we know what the structure is, it's not very difficult to understand the omissions too.</p> <p>So, we might say <code>\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b/\u306a\u3054\u3084\u306b\u7740\u9678\u3057\u305f\u3068\u3053</code> -- <code>I just landed at Nagoya.</code></p> <p>And we often use these abbreviations like <code>\u3068\u3053</code> -- leaving off the <code>\u308d</code> and the <code>\u3060</code></p> <p>from <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3060</code> -- when we are trying to express a sense of immediacy.</p> <p>But people do it on various occasions, just as they do the equivalent thing in English.</p> <p>So, we see that <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d</code> can be literal, a <code>place in space</code>.</p> <p>It can express very abstract concepts like an <code>aspect of someone's personality</code>, and</p> <p>it can very often mean a <code>place in time</code>.</p> <p>And it can be used in various ways as a place in time;</p> <p>for example, if someone says <code>\u3044\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306b\u6765\u305f\u306d?</code></p> <p>That is most likely to mean <code>You came at a good time, didn't you?</code></p> <p>NOT <code>You came to a good place, didn't you?</code></p> <p>although in fact it can mean either.</p> <p>Remember that in Japanese, context is king..</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/37-new-structure-secrets-%E3%81%AA-vs-%E3%81%AE-%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B-%E3%81%9F%E3%82%8B-adjectives/","title":"37.

Japanese is a very noun-centric language.</p> <p>We could be tempted to attribute this fact to the fact that there are a lot of foreign</p> <p>words in Japanese and all of them are nouns.</p> <p>A great part of the Japanese vocabulary comes from Chinese.</p> <p>There are also words from English and German and other languages, but they pale into insignificance compared to the older Chinese vocabulary in Japanese, which is similar to the large amount of the English vocabulary which is Latin, either directly from Latin or indirectly via French.</p> <p>The difference is that, as I've said, in Japanese everything that comes from any language other than native Japanese comes in as a noun.</p> <p>And I said that we might be tempted to attribute to that the noun-centric nature of Japanese,</p> <p>but in fact, I would say it's the other way around.</p> <p>It's because Japanese is so fundamentally noun-centric that it seems natural to import</p> <p>anything into the language as a noun.</p> <p>Once it comes in as a noun, if we want to use it in the manner of a verb or in the manner</p> <p>of an adjective, there are ways of doing this.</p> <p>And we're somewhat familiar with those ways, aren't we?</p> <p>When a noun comes in from Chinese, if we want to use it as a verb,</p> <p>we turn it into what the dictionaries call a <code>\u3059\u308b verb</code>.</p> <p>And in this one case I have no quarrel with the dictionaries.</p> <p><code>\u3059\u308b verb</code> is a real thing, but this is an exception because in nearly all other cases</p> <p>where a noun comes in, it stays a noun even when it's used for a different purpose.</p> <p>So, let's start by looking at \u3059\u308b verbs.</p> <p>They're very simple.</p> <p>If we take the word <code>\u52c9\u5f37</code> from Chinese, which comes in as the noun meaning <code>the act of studying</code>,</p> <p>we can say <code>\u52c9\u5f37\u3092\u3059\u308b</code>, which means to <code>do the act of studying</code>, but</p> <p>we can also glue the words directly together and say <code>\u52c9\u5f37\u3059\u308b</code>, which means <code>(to) study</code>.</p> <p>We have, in effect, by welding <code>\u3059\u308b</code> onto the noun turned the combination into a true verb.</p> <p>So, in this particular case, we can say that a noun came in from Chinese and really became</p> <p>naturalized as a \u3059\u308b verb.</p> <p>However, if we want to use a noun as an adjective, let's say the noun <code>\u7dba\u9e97/\u304d\u308c\u3044</code>,</p> <p>which means <code>prettiness</code> or <code>cleanness</code>, it never stops being a noun.</p> <p></p> <p>The dictionaries and textbooks tell us about <code>\u306a-adjectives</code>, but the word is really nonsense.</p> <p>There is no such thing as a \u306a-adjective.</p> <p>There is an adjectival noun which continues to act in almost every respect like any other noun. The only difference between an adjectival noun and any other noun is that we can use <code>\u306a</code> with it.</p> <p>And <code>\u306a</code>, as we know, is simply the connective form of <code>\u3060</code>.</p> <p>So, we can say <code>\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u306f \u7dba\u9e97/\u304d\u308c\u3044 \u3060</code> -- <code>the child is pretty</code> --</p> <p>or we can say <code>\u304d\u308c\u3044\u306a\u5973\u306e\u5b50</code>, which means <code>pretty child</code>.</p> <p><code>\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060</code> means <code>is pretty</code> and <code>\u304d\u308c\u3044\u306a</code> also means <code>is pretty</code>,</p> <p>so we're saying <code>child is pretty</code> or <code>is-pretty child</code>.</p> <p><code>\u306a</code> and <code>\u3060</code> are the same copula.</p> <p>Now, the reason these are called adjectival nouns is that we can't do this exact thing with other nouns.</p> <p>But we can do something very close, and we'll come to that very shortly.</p> <p>But I'll just note before passing on that we can say that there are essentially</p> <p>two types of adjectival noun, and that is, the ones like <code>\u7dba\u9e97/\u304d\u308c\u3044</code>, which really are not used as ordinary nouns at all; they're almost entirely dedicated to being adjectival: we don't talk about a person's <code>\u304d\u308c\u3044</code>.</p> <p>And then there are the ones which continue to work as independent nouns, like <code>\u5143\u6c17</code>.</p> <p>So we can say <code>\u5b50\u3069\u3082\u304c\u5143\u6c17\u3060</code> -- <code>the child is lively</code>;</p> <p>we can say <code>\u5143\u6c17\u306a\u5b50\u3069\u3082</code> -- <code>lively child</code>.</p> <p>But we can also say things like <code>\u5143\u6c17\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u3066</code>, which loosely translated means <code>cheer up</code>,</p> <p>but literally translated means <code>get out your \u5143\u6c17</code>.</p> <p><code>\u5143\u6c17</code> is a thing here: it's marked by the \u3092-particle, and you can't put a logical particle</p> <p>onto anything but a noun.</p> <p>So, <code>\u5143\u6c17</code>, even though it's primarily adjectival and is classed as an adjectival noun,</p> <p>works as both an adjectival and a noun.</p> <p>Now, if a noun is not classed as an adjectival noun we can still use it adjectivally.</p> <p>So, the word <code>\u9b54\u6cd5/\u307e\u307b\u3046</code>, which means <code>magic</code>, can be used as a noun just as it can in English.</p> <p>We can talk about magic as a thing.</p> <p>But we can also say <code>\u9b54\u6cd5\u306e\u5e3d\u5b50</code> -- <code>magic hat</code>.</p> <p>It's not an adjectival noun, but as you see, we can achieve pretty much the same effect</p> <p>just by using <code>\u306e</code> instead of <code>\u306a</code>.</p> <p>There are also some words that can be either \u306e- or \u306a-adjectivals.</p> <p>A good example of this is <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70/\u3075\u3057\u304e</code>, which means a <code>mystery</code> or a <code>wonder</code>.</p> <p>It tends to get used very often as an adjective as in <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u5c4b\u6577/\u3084\u3057\u304d</code> -- <code>mysterious mansion</code> \u2013 but it's also used quite often as a noun.</p> <p>We can talk about the school <code>\u4e03\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70</code> -- which means literally the *seven wonders*</p> <p>or <code>seven mysteries</code> of the school, and what it usually refers to is in fact ghost stories connected to the school,</p> <p>such as <code>\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u306e\u306f\u306a\u3053\u3055\u3093</code>, who you may have heard of -- the girl who haunts the lavatory.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70</code>, if we're using it adjectivally, it can be what the dictionaries call either</p> <p>a <code>\u306a-adjective</code> or a <code>\u306e-adjective</code>, that is to say,</p> <p>we can use either <code>\u306a</code> or <code>\u306e</code> when we're using it adjectivally.</p> <p></p> <p>Is there a difference between the two?</p> <p>I would say yes, there is a subtle difference.</p> <p><code>Alice in Wonderland</code> in Japanese is called <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9</code>.</p> <p>Now, it could have been called <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9</code>, but I think <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9</code></p> <p>is a much more appropriate title and a much better translation of the original title, <code>Alice in Wonderland</code>.</p> <p><code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9</code> would mean <code>Alice of the mysterious country</code>, to say literally</p> <p><code>Alice of the mysterious-is country</code>.</p> <p><code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9</code> implies more <code>Alice of the country of wonders</code>.</p> <p>We're leaving <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70</code> more as a noun in itself and attributing it to the country.</p> <p>It's a subtle difference, but it's one that's worth bearing in mind,</p> <p>especially where there is a choice between the two.</p> <p>But the most important thing to bear in mind is that whether a noun is an adjectival noun</p> <p>or an ordinary noun being used as an adjective with <code>\u306e</code>, it's always going to function as a noun.</p> <p>Now, the dictionaries also like to mix things up by telling us that there are other kinds of adjective too;</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/37-new-structure-secrets-%E3%81%AA-vs-%E3%81%AE-%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B-%E3%81%9F%E3%82%8B-adjectives/#adjectives-nouns","title":"\u306a\u308b &amp;

Thus, I highly recommend reading through Nihil\u2019s comments under the video. Unfortunately, since Dolly is no longer around, we may not entirely know what she meant here, but she does admit in the comments also that she did not find what \u306a\u308b actually means (in full form).

<code>\u8349/\u305d\u3046</code> is the \u97f3\u8aad\u307f-reading of <code>\u8349/\u304f\u3055</code>, <code>grass</code>,</p> <p>and together they make <code>\u6d77\u8349</code> -- <code>seaweed</code>, because <code>grass</code> can mean any kind of plant-life, which is why we have Grass Pokemon.</p> <p>And this also happens in the case of combinations that don't exist in English, such as <code>\u6307\u8f2a</code>.</p> <p><code>\u6307/\u3086\u3073</code> is <code>finger</code>, <code>\u8f2a/\u308f</code> is a <code>ring</code>, so <code>\u6307\u8f2a</code> is a finger ring.</p> <p>However, we can see larger combinations too, for things that would be phrases rather than words in English. And again this is done in exactly the same way as it happens in English,</p> <p>so it should really be no cause for alarm.</p> <p>For example, we have <code>\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u80b2</code> -- <code>\u5927\u5b66</code> means <code>university</code>;</p> <p><code>\u6559\u80b2</code> means <code>education</code> or <code>training</code>.</p> <p>So <code>\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u80b2/\u3060\u3044\u304c\u304f\u304d\u3087\u3046\u3044\u304f</code> is <code>university education</code>.</p> <p>And, as you see, again it works exactly the same way as in English.</p> <p>We don't need, in English, to say <code>education at a university</code> every time; we can say <code>university education</code>.</p> <p>And in Japanese we can say <code>\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u80b2</code>, and we don't need any <code>\u306a</code> or <code>\u306e</code> or anything else to join them. They create a commonly used phrase on their own.</p> <p>We can't do this every time. It's like adjectival nouns.</p> <p>There are certain expressions where this is known and accepted</p> <p>and certain kinds of construction where this is frequently done.</p> <p>Now, we may see longer blocks of kanji which can look very daunting until you understand what they are, how they work and what they're likely to be.</p> <p>It's often done in the case of institutions and things like that.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u80fd\u529b\u8a66\u9a13</code>. Now, that looks quite a daunting block of kanji perhaps,</p> <p>when you're not familiar with the idea.</p> <p>But what this actually is is the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, which you've probably</p> <p>heard of and of which I'm not a great advocate.</p> <p>And we can see that exactly the same thing is happening in Japanese as in the English equivalent:</p> <p><code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e</code> -- <code>Japanese language</code>; <code>\u80fd\u529b</code> -- <code>proficiency</code> or <code>ability</code>; <code>\u8a66\u9a13</code> -- <code>examination</code>.</p> <p>And exactly as in English we can use one noun to modify another noun</p> <p>and then the two of them together to modify the third noun -- and so on.</p> <p>So, <code>\u65e5\u672c</code> modifies <code>\u8a9e</code> (what kind of a language? Japanese language).</p> <p><code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e</code> modifies <code>\u80fd\u529b</code> (what kind of proficiency? Japanese language proficiency).</p> <p>And then all of it modifies <code>\u8a66\u9a13</code> (what kind of exam?

(indicated by tone in speech)</p> <p>We can say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3002</code> -- that means <code>That isn't Sakura</code>.</p> <p>We can say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\uff1f</code> and that means <code>That's Sakura, isn't it?</code></p> <p>But we can also say, perhaps meeting Sakura after quite a long time, <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\uff01</code>,</p> <p>and that certainly doesn't mean it isn't Sakura and it's not a question either.</p> <p>We've actually recognized her and what we're saying is something that could perhaps</p> <p>best be rendered into English as <code>If it isn't Sakura!</code> meaning it is Sakura.</p> <p>Now there's nothing particularly mystical and Japanese about this.</p> <p>We do the same sort of thing in English.</p> <p>For example, if we said <code>She came on Saturday</code>, that's simply conveying a piece of information.</p> <p>If we say <code>She came on Saturday?</code> we're asking whether she came on Saturday or not.</p> <p>And if we say <code>She came on Saturday?!</code> we've just received the information that</p> <p>she came on Saturday and we are expressing surprise about it.</p> <p></p> <p>We know how to interpret this in English and it's easy to learn how to interpret <code>\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044</code></p> <p>in Japanese once we understand the range of meaning it possesses.</p> <p><code>\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044</code> gets used with other meanings too.</p> <p>Particularly, it gets used as a negative question tag-ending very much like <code>\u306d</code>.</p> <p>For example, we might say <code>\u6691\u3044\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044</code> which means pretty much the same thing as <code>\u6691\u3044\u306d</code>.</p> <p>It's something like a tag-question, expecting our listener to agree with us.</p> <p>And we can note here that there's no ambiguity at all in this, because <code>\u6691\u3044\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044</code> is not the negative of <code>\u6691\u3044</code> \u2013 that's <code>\u6691\u304f\u306a\u3044</code>.</p> <p>And it can also be put after verbs.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u3082\u3046\u8a00\u3063\u305f\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044</code>, which means <code>I already said that, didn't I?</code></p> <p>We should also note that <code>\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044</code> is often reduced to just <code>\u3058\u3083\u3093</code> in very colloquial speech, and it's often used in that way when it's affirming something or asking for confirmation.</p> <p>Now, it's clear that these expressions are very colloquial and in fact so colloquial</p> <p>that when we use them with a verb or an adjective they're not in fact grammatical.</p> <p>And the reason for this, as I've already alluded to, is that, for example,</p> <p><code>\u6691\u3044\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044</code> is not the negative of <code>\u6691\u3044</code> because that's <code>\u6691\u304f\u306a\u3044</code>.</p> <p>Why can't we use <code>\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044</code> with verbs or adjectives?</p> <p>Well, that's because, as we learned right back in the first lesson,</p> <p><code>\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044</code> is in fact <code>\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044</code>, which is the negative of the copula.</p> <p>So if we say <code>\u3053\u308c\u306f\u30da\u30f3\u3060</code> we're saying <code>This is a pen</code>; if we say <code>\u3053\u308c\u306f\u30da\u30f3\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044</code>,</p> <p>we're saying <code>This is not a pen</code>, and you can't properly use <code>\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044</code> with anything but two nouns.</p> <p></p> <p>I don't actually think that these colloquial statements are fundamentally ungrammatical.</p> <p>It's just that being colloquial may leave a few steps out of the process.</p> <p>There are in fact much more formal ways of using <code>\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044</code> as a positive statement,</p> <p>but these of course tidy up the grammar.</p> <p>So, for example, if we say <code>\u305d\u306e\u7406\u8ad6\u304c\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b</code>,</p> <p>we're saying <code>Might that theory not be in error?</code></p> <p></p> <p>And we see we have essentially the same construction that we've been dealing with before:</p> <p><code>\u305d\u306e\u7406\u8ad6\u304c\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b... \u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044</code>, but that <code>\u306e</code> turns it into a grammatical statement.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>Because <code>\u305d\u306e\u7406\u8ad6\u304c\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b</code> means literally <code>that theory exists in a state of mistaking</code>. That's a verbal clause complete in itself.</p> <p></p> <p>However, when we add <code>\u306e</code>, that <code>\u306e</code>, as we've seen in other lessons, plays the role</p> <p>of a pronoun like <code>thing</code> or <code>one</code> which is being modified by <code>\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b</code>.</p> <p>So now we have <code>that theory exists in a state of error one</code>.</p> <p>So we have two nouns and we now need the copula to join them together.</p> <p></p> <p>So <code>\u305d\u306e\u7406\u8ad6\u304c\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044</code> means <code>that theory existing-in-error-one is not</code>.</p> <p>The <code>\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b</code> doesn't add anything grammatically to the statement.</p> <p>As we know, adjectives like <code>\u306a\u3044</code> stand on their own.</p> <p>They don't require a <code>\u3060</code>, even though they get a <code>\u3067\u3059</code> as a mere decoration, a non-grammatical decoration, in formal speech, so what <code>\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b</code> is doing here is it's simply a flag put at the end of the complete grammatical statement: <code>\u305d\u306e\u7406\u8ad6\u304c\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b</code> turns it explicitly into a question and into a suggestion rather than a statement.</p> <p>So we're saying <code>Might that theory not be a mistaken one</code>?</p> <p>Now, this can mean what it seems to say.</p> <p>It can mean that we're in some doubt and we're actually asking whether that might not be the case.</p> <p>But a lot of the time this is used not just as an assertion but as a quite strong assertion.</p> <p>We might use this to sum up our argument when we have definitively disproved the theory in question.</p> <p>An American writer or speaker might sum up such an argument with \"It is now clear</p> <p>to anyone with an intelligence greater than that of a Roomba that this theory holds about as much water as a topless thimble in the Sahara Desert.\"</p> <p>However, that kind of definite assertion in Japanese is not considered either polite or very persuasive.</p> <p>It sounds as if you're trying to make up for a weak argument by a strong assertion.</p> <p>So the equivalent Japanese speaker may sum up the same completely persuasive argument</p> <p>with <code>\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3089\u305d\u306e\u7406\u8ad6\u306f\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b</code>.</p> <p>And that means exactly the same thing, allowing for cultural differences\u2026</p> <p> ::: info if anything is still unclear, delving into the comments of the video might be helpful. :::</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/39-the-%E3%81%8B-particle-buried-questions-%E3%81%8B%E3%81%AA-%E3%82%82%E3%82%93%E3%81%8B-%E3%81%8B%E3%81%A9%E3%81%86%E3%81%8B/","title":"39.

another video, is a marker that indicates addressing something to yourself.</p> <p>So, you're saying <code>Will Sakura come?</code> addressing that to yourself.</p> <p>The way we would say that in

structure as a whole to understand what they're really doing.</p> <p>They're bundling something into a question, so a proposition becomes a question which</p> <p>is a noun-like entity which we can then add something like \"do you know / I don't know /</p> <p>I can't be sure<code> or </code>I wonder (I'm addressing this question to myself).\"</p> <p>Now, from this proposition-making quality and

certain,</p> <p>in fact in this particular case, a thing that hasn't happened: we're not saying that</p> <p>the person HAS seen a ghost, we're only saying that she had a face AS IF she had seen a ghost.</p> <p>So we're marking the proposition that she'd seen a ghost as a question and then continuing to comment on it, and in this case we actually are attaching a logical particle,</p> <p>the logical particle \u306e, to the \u304b-marked noun-like entity that we have made of the proposition that she is seeing a ghost.</p> <p></p> <p>So with a \u306e-particle, unlike the \u304c and \u3092-particle, we can attach this to a \u304b-marked entity.</p> <p>Now, there is another use of -\u304b, which is a little different but still closely related</p> <p>to its question-making

It's called the non-past tense, and a lot of people think this is confusing. Why can't Japanese have a simple present tense like English instead of something vague and mysterious like a non-past tense?</p> <p></p> <p>Well, actually it isn't confusing at all, and what makes it confusing is, for a change, not the fact that Japanese is taught in a strange way, but the fact that English is taught in a strange way. The truth is that the Japanese non-past tense is very similar to the English non-past tense.</p> <p>What is the English non-past tense? Well, it is the plain dictionary form of English words: eat, walk, etc. Why do I call it a non-past tense? Well, let's take an example. Suppose you get a message on your \u643a\u5e2f/\u3051\u3044\u305f\u3044 (phone) saying, <code>I walked to the cafe and now I eat cake and drink coffee</code>. What would you know about the person who sent that message? Well, you'd know that it was not a native English speaker, wouldn't you? Because no native English speaker says <code>I eat cake and I drink coffee</code> when they mean <code>I am eating cake and drinking coffee right now</code>.</p> <p>When so we say <code>I eat cake</code>? Well, we might say it when we mean that we eat cake sometimes: \"I eat cake. I'm not one of these people who doesn't eat cake. I do eat cake. Whenever there's any cake around, I eat it. But that doesn't mean I'm eating cake right at this moment.\"</p> <p>When else do we use the English non-past plain form of verbs? Well, sometimes we use them for future events: <code>Next week I fly to Tokyo.</code> <code>Next month I have an exam.</code> And sometimes we use them for something that's going on right now, but not mostly. For example, in a literary description: \"The sun sinks over the sea and a small happy robot runs across the beach.\" But that isn't the way we use it most of the time in everyday speech, is it?</p> <p>So, the Japanese non-past tense is very similar in the way it functions to the English non-past tense. If you understand one you can pretty much understand the other. Most of the time, the Japanese non-past tense refers to future events. <code>\u3044\u306c\u304c\u305f\u3079\u308b</code> - <code>The dog will-eat</code>; <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304f</code> - <code>Sakura will-walk.</code></p> <p></p> <p>The way we've been using it up to now - <code>Sakura walks</code> - is possible, but it isn't the most natural way.

A white engine is an element that could be an engine but in this case it's NOT the engine of this sentence. It's modifying, or telling us more about, one of the core elements of the sentence.</p> <p></p> <p>So, the core of this sentence is <code>\u3044\u306c\u304c\u3044\u308b</code> - <code>the dog is</code>. But the dog isn't just existing \u2013 the dog is doing something. And that white engine tells us what it is doing. It is <code>eating</code>. And we're going to see this white engine structure over and over again as we go deeper into Japanese.</p> <p>And just as in English we don't say <code>the dog is eat</code>, we use a special form of the verb that goes along with the verb of being. So in English we say <code>is walking</code>, <code>is eating</code>. In Japanese we say <code>\u98df\u3079\u3066\u3044\u308b/\u305f\u3079\u3066\u3044\u308b</code>, <code>\u6b69\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b/\u3042\u308b\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b</code>.</p> <p>Now, how do we form this <code>\u3066-form</code>, which is the form we use for making the continuous present? With a word like <code>\u98df\u3079\u308b/\u305f\u3079\u308b</code>, it's very easy indeed. All we have to do is take off the <code>\u308b</code> and put <code>\u3066</code> in its place. \u305f\u3079\u308b becomes \u305f\u3079\u3066.</p> <p>The bad news is that with other verbs, we do have slightly different ways of attaching the <code>\u3066</code>. Apart from the plain \u308b-form, there are four other ways. The textbooks will say five, but in fact two of them are so similar that we can treat them as four. And I've made a video on exactly what these ways are (Lesson 5, so the next lesson). And it makes it much simpler than most explanations.</p> <p>So it's very important to watch that so that you can learn how to form the continuous present tense. The good news: it's perfectly regular. Once you know the ending of a verb you also know how to put the <code>\u3066</code> onto it. The only one that's a bit tricky is \u308b-ending verbs, but the video will explain that.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/4-japanese-verb-tenses/#past-tense","title":"Past tense","text":"<p>So, how do we put things into the past tense? Fortunately that's very easy indeed. All we do is add <code>\u305f</code> \u2013 that's the whole thing. So, <code>\u3044\u306c\u304c\u305f\u3079\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>dog will-eat</code> / <code>\u3044\u306c\u304c\u305f\u3079\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>dog ate</code>.</p> <p>Now, there are different ways of attaching <code>\u305f</code> to different kinds of verb, verbs with different endings, but the good news here is that they are exactly the same as the ways that you attach <code>\u3066</code>. So once you've learned the ways that <code>\u3066</code> attaches, you've also learned the ways that <code>\u305f</code> attaches. So if you watch that \u3066-form video (Lesson 5), you'll be able to do both the continuous present and the past.</p> <p>Now, there's one more thing about time expressions that is useful to learn now.

The \u3092 is the Direct Object (noun) + verb (\u52c9\u5f37\u3092 + \u3059\u308b) &amp; the \u52c9\u5f37\u3059\u308b is a \u3059\u308b verb. :::</p> <p>We can use the \u3092 to mark a direct object of any verb, but we can only drop that \u3092 in the case of \u3059\u308b nouns.

Noun. At least I can\u2019t find anything about \u9759\u304b\u3059\u308b etc. Dolly also seems to allude at multiple points (Lesson 8) to that adverbs like \u3086\u3063\u304f\u308a could be classed as a kind of noun, although stuff like Jisho/Yomichan lists them as Adverbs and their name \u526f\u8a5e (\u3075\u304f\u3057) is different of course, means Adverb, so it would be just a special sub-class. :::</p> <p>I think that the term <code>Adverbial Noun</code> might be what that \u526f\u8a5e refers to for Dolly, where usually they are called Adverbs, but they might be this very special class of nouns in Japanese, so why Dolly calls them that. As to why we can drop the \u306b, since \u3086\u3063\u304f\u308a is already \u526f\u8a5e on default. So, we'll take one that ends in the typical <code>\u308a</code>: <code>\u3086\u3063\u304f\u308a</code> -- that means *slow or leisurely*</p> <p>and we can say <code>\u3086\u3063\u304f\u308a\u306b\u3059\u308b</code> -- <code>act in a leisurely manner</code>, <code>\u3086\u3063\u304f\u308a\u306b\u6b69\u304f</code> -- <code>walk slowly</code>.</p> <p>But we can also say <code>\u3086\u3063\u304f\u308a\u3059\u308b</code>, <code>\u3086\u3063\u304f\u308a\u6b69\u304f</code>.

Whereas \u307e\u307e is what Dolly is going to be talking about. It also has a Kanji form \u5118 or \u4fad, but that is not really used. So \u307e\u307e \u2260 \u30de\u30de, different things. \u307e\u307e marks unchanged state, \u30de\u30de means <code>mom/bar mistress</code>... :::</p> <p>I've even seen it described as a particle, which it certainly isn't.</p> <p>And they tell you that it means <code>as it is / as we wish it to be / as we would like it to be</code>,</p> <p>that it means a state or a condition.</p> <p>Now, all those things are things that we might say in English in relation to certain uses of the word.</p> <p>But none of them express what the word actually means.</p> <p>In any case, if it meant <code>as it is</code> or <code>as we wish it to be</code>, what kind of a word would it be?</p> <p>So the first thing to ask ourselves is <code>What kind of a word is it?</code></p> <p>And, as I explained in our last lesson, nearly all Japanese words fall into one of three categories: nouns, verbs, and adjectives.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u307e\u307e</code> is not a verb: it doesn't end in -\u3046 or any \u3046-row kana.</p> <p>It's not an adjective: doesn't end in -\u3044.</p> <p>So the chances are it's a noun, and that's exactly what it is. It's a noun.</p> <p>So, what kind of a noun is it? What does it mean?</p> <p>What is a <code>\u307e\u307e</code>? A <code>\u307e\u307e</code> is a thing; it's a noun. What kind of a thing is it?</p> <p>Well, it's a very simple thing, a very straightforward thing, and once we know what it is</p> <p>we can understand it in all circumstances.</p> <p>A <code>\u307e\u307e</code> is an unchanged condition.</p> <p>Wherever you see <code>\u307e\u307e</code>, you can read <code>unchanged condition</code>.</p> <p>There's one circumstance in which it has a slightly extended meaning and apart from that</p> <p>-- which is very simple and we'll come to that shortly --</p> <p>we have the definition, the understanding of <code>\u307e\u307e</code>: <code>unchanged condition</code>.</p> <p>So, let's look at some of the ways in which it's used.</p> <p>We can say <code>\u81ea\u7136\u306e\u307e\u307e\u306e\u68ee</code> -- that's <code>a forest in its natural (unchanged) state</code>.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u81ea\u7136</code> is nature<code> and </code>\u307e\u307e<code> is </code>unchanged state<code> or </code>unchanged condition\".</p> <p>So, <code>\u81ea\u7136\u306e\u307e\u307e</code> is the <code>unchanged condition of nature</code>.</p> <p><code>\u81ea\u7136\u306e\u307e\u307e\u306e\u68ee</code> is <code>the forest in the unchanged condition of nature</code>.</p> <p>Now, when you're in Japan somebody may offer you \u679d\u8c46/\u3048\u3060\u307e\u3081,</p> <p>which are beans which grow from the branches of trees,</p> <p>which is why they're called \u679d\u8c46 (which means <code>branch bean</code>).</p> <p>And you might look at them, they're not cooked or anything,</p> <p>you might say <code>\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u3067\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b\u306e?</code></p> <p>-- <code>Can you eat them just as they are / can you eat them in their unchanged condition?</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, that <code>\u3067</code> is in fact the copula, so we're saying <code>being their unchanged condition, can we eat them?</code></p> <p>Now, there's one thing we can do with <code>\u307e\u307e</code> that we can't do with all nouns</p> <p>and that is that we can drop that <code>\u3067</code>.</p> <p>So we can say <code>\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b?</code></p> <p>Now, we can say that this is because <code>\u307e\u307e</code> is something like an adverbial noun</p> <p>that we discussed last week, where you are allowed to drop the particle in certain cases,</p> <p>but I don't think we necessarily even have to go that far.</p> <p><code>An unchanged condition</code> is by definition a condition that could change but hasn't changed.</p> <p>So, I think in cases like this if we say <code>\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>,</p> <p>we're saying

expression.</p> <p>We're saying <code>while they're in their unchanged condition</code>,</p> <p>so we're essentially talking about a time period,</p> <p>the time period during which they are in their unchanged condition.</p> <p>So this is actually how I would tend to look at it.</p> <p><code>During the period when they're in their unchanged condition, can we eat them?</code></p> <p>In any case, there's no doubt what the word means.</p> <p>It means <code>unchanged condition</code>.</p> <p>We can say <code>\u30d1\u30b8\u30e3\u30de\u306e\u307e\u307e\u671d\u3054\u306f\u3093\u3092\u98df\u3079\u308b</code>.</p> <p>That means <code>Eat breakfast while we're still in our pyjamas</code>.</p> <p>In other words, <code>in the unchanged condition of being still in our pyjamas, eat breakfast</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And as we can see, once again the implication here is that the condition could change but hasn't changed.</p> <p><code>\u3044\u3064\u307e\u3067\u3082\u82e5\u3044\u307e\u307e\u3067\u3044\u305f\u3044</code> -- <code>I'd like to stay young forever.</code></p> <p><code>I'd like to stay in the unchanged condition of being young forever.</code></p> <p></p> <p>And notice here that we're saying <code>\u82e5\u3044\u307e\u307e</code>,</p> <p>so you see <code>\u82e5\u3044</code>, the adjective, is doing what adjectives always do, qualifying a noun.</p> <p>And the noun it's qualifying is <code>\u307e\u307e</code>: <code>the unchanged condition of being young</code>.</p> <p>Now, there's a use of <code>\u307e\u307e</code> that you'll probably come across quite often,</p> <p>and that is <code>\u601d\u3044\u306e\u307e\u307e</code> or <code>\u5fc3\u306e\u307e\u307e</code>.</p> <p>And what this means is <code>in the unchanged condition that's in our thoughts</code> or <code>...in our hearts</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So what does this actually mean?</p> <p>Well, it's always applied to something that is outside ourselves,</p> <p>so we're talking about something outside ourselves being in the unchanged condition,</p> <p>the exact same condition, as what is inside ourselves.</p> <p>So this essentially means making the outside world conform to our thoughts, our desires, our will.</p> <p>And this can under certain circumstances imply selfishness, but it doesn't need to.</p> <p>I think the first time I heard it was in an anime where the characters were underwater.</p> <p>They were able to breathe but they found that they couldn't move the way that they wanted to,</p> <p>just as one can't in water.</p> <p>And they said <code>\u601d\u3044\u306e\u307e\u307e\u306b\u52d5\u3051\u306a\u3044</code> --</p> <p><code>we are unable to move in the unchanged condition of our thoughts</code></p> <p>or <code>...the unchanged condition of our will or desire</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, we should understand here that <code>\u601d\u3044</code> sometimes does imply desire.</p> <p>For example, when we say <code>\u7247\u601d\u3044</code>, which is literally <code>one-sided thought</code> or <code>one-side thought</code>, what that actually means is <code>unrequited love</code>.</p> <p>It means having a desire for someone but it's only one side of the desire.</p> <p>The other person doesn't reciprocate that desire.</p> <p>So it's <code>\u7247\u601d\u3044</code> -- <code>one-sided thought</code> or <code>one-sided desire</code>.</p> <p>So <code>\u601d\u3044\u306e\u307e\u307e</code> is <code>in the unchanged condition of one's thought or desire</code>.</p> <p>And it's really from this use of <code>\u307e\u307e</code> that we get <code>\u308f\u304c\u307e\u307e</code>, which I'm sure you've heard,</p> <p>which means <code>selfish</code> or <code>selfishness</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Why does it mean that?</p> <p>Well, <code>\u6211\u304c/\u308f\u304c</code> means <code>I</code> or <code>we</code> and it can be put next to a noun to denote possession of it. So we can say <code>\u308f\u304c\u5bb6</code>, which means <code>my house</code> or <code>our house</code>.</p> <p><code>\u308f\u304c\u307e\u307e</code> means <code>my unchanged condition</code>, but this clearly is influenced by expressions like <code>\u601d\u3044\u306e\u307e\u307e</code> or <code>\u5fc3\u306e\u307e\u307e</code>.</p> <p>So this <code>\u308f\u304c\u307e\u307e</code> means <code>my unchanged condition</code> implying <code>my will</code>,</p> <p><code>wanting the world to go in accordance with my will,</code></p> <p>wanting the world to be <code>\u601d\u3044\u306e\u307e\u307e</code>, <code>\u5fc3\u306e\u307e\u307e</code>.</p> <p>So as we see the whole of <code>\u307e\u307e</code>, we don't have to have all these different definitions of it.</p> <p>We can see that every time we use it it means the same thing.</p> <p>It means <code>unchanged condition</code>...</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/43-paradigm-shift-cut-through-the-confusion/","title":"43. PARADIGM SHIFT: Cut through the confusion","text":"<p>Japanese learning PARADIGM SHIFT: Cut through the confusion. Lesson 43</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to talk about what I rather over-dramatically refer to as <code>The Final Problem</code>.</p> <p>What I mean by that is that we're going to unlock a new area of Japanese</p> <p>and we're going to do it by the same method that we started with, that is,</p> <p>by looking at Japanese as Japanese and not as English written in some secret code.</p> <p>The reason I call it <code>the final problem</code> is because this is the one problem</p> <p>that some of my most astute and analytical pupils find with my Japanese-structure models.</p> <p>For the most part, if somebody understands my models, they become self-evident.</p> <p>And that's what I base my work on.</p> <p>I don't ask anyone to trust me.</p> <p>See if they work.</p> <p>If they don't work, throw them away.</p> <p>If they do work, use them.</p> <p>There's no act of faith involved anywhere.</p> <p>Now, I take this one problem as a tribute to my work.</p> <p>Partly because, of course, there only is one problem,</p> <p>which out of a whole and very radical model of Japanese is pretty interesting.</p> <p>But the second reason is this: people have this problem because I've spoiled them.</p> <p>I say that somewhat humorously, but the truth is that people come out of this world of English <code>Japanese grammar explanations</code> in Genki and the various Japanese grammar (so-called) websites and they're leaving a world of an entangled mass of strange things that just happen to mean what they mean for no particular reason and with a whole range of exceptions and random rules into a world of crystalline logic where everything makes sense, where everything is what it is for a good reason.</p> <p></p> <p>And so when they come across something that looks like an exception or a random rule,</p> <p>they want to get rid of it.</p> <p>They won't tolerate even one of these things any more and I can't blame them.</p> <p>However, this is not a random rule.</p> <p>This is something that's very understandable if we can make the same kind of paradigm shift that we made in the first place and see it as it really is in Japanese, not look at it through English eyes.</p> <p>So what is this? Let's take an example.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3060</code>, we've learned that this does not mean <code>I like crepes</code>.</p> <p>If you think it means <code>I like crepes</code>, then you've really</p> <p>given up all hope of ever understanding Japanese structure.</p> <p>Because, as we know, every Japanese sentence has two core elements.</p> <p>It can have any one of three engines, which can be a verb, an adjective, or a noun plus copula.</p> <p>And the second part of the core sentence is always the same: it's a noun marked with \u304c.</p> <p>We can't always see it, but it's always there.</p> <p></p> <p>And those two elements, the engine and the \u304c-marked subject (or main carriage),</p> <p>are the core of any sentence. They're the only things we need in a sentence.</p> <p>We've got to have those two, and everything else in a logical clause is telling us more</p> <p>about either the engine or the \u304c-marked carriage.</p> <p>It can't do anything else.</p> <p></p> <p>The core of the sentence is the sentence and everything else is an appendage to one of those two core elements.</p> <p>So, with <code>(\u79c1\u306f) \u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u304c\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044</code>, the \u304c-marked carriage is not <code>I</code>, so it can't be <code>I want to eat crepes</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Because <code>I</code> am not doing something here, the crepes are the \u304c-marked main carriage.</p> <p>And the head of the sentence, the engine, is not a verb, it's an adjective.</p> <p>It's the helper adjective <code>-\u305f\u3044</code>.</p> <p>It's attached to a verb, but the actual engine of the sentence isn't a verb, it's the adjective <code>-\u305f\u3044</code>.</p> <p>It can't mean <code>want</code>, because <code>want</code> is a verb.</p> <p>So what this is actually saying is that the quality of crepes is such that it induces want in me.</p> <p>This is a wordy way of putting it, but it avoids any kind of English-based misreading of the sentence.</p> <p>That's what it actually means.</p> <p>It's describing the crepes adjectivally, and what it's saying about them is that they have</p> <p>the quality of making me want to eat them.</p> <p>And what we learned right from the beginning is that English is a very ego-centric language.</p> <p>If there is an action, a subjectivity, it always wants to put an ego-actor at the center.</p> <p>Japanese doesn't have that strong imperative.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, if we look at it in terms of subjectivities --</p> <p>because a lot of this is to do with subjective feelings, as a lot of language is --</p> <p>we can look at subjectivities in two ways.</p> <p>We can either look at them with the thing that induces the subjectivity as the focus,</p> <p>the fulcrum, of the subjectivity, so <code>crepes which induce desire in me</code> are the fulcrum of this sentence. (Japanese) <code>Crepes are inducing eat desire in me.</code></p> <p>Or we can look at the subjectivity as an activity -- wanting -- and then we put <code>me</code> at the center. We put the ego at the center and we say <code>I desire to eat crepes</code>. (English)</p> <p>Now, both of these are fairly natural.</p> <p>A subjectivity is in fact something that we passively experience and that is induced in us</p> <p>by something on the outside of us.</p> <p>That is a perfectly valid way of looking at things,</p> <p>and perhaps more valid than the English ego-centric way. Certainly no less valid.</p> <p>Japanese happens to prefer this way of looking at it; English prefers the other.</p> <p>And this spills over into all kinds of areas.</p> <p>So, for example, Japanese is very happy to say <code>\u6c34\u304c\u72ac\u306b\u98f2\u307e\u308c\u305f</code> which means</p> <p><code>The water drink-received from the dog</code>. The key actor of this sentence is the water, not the dog. The water is receiving the act of drinking from the dog.</p> <p>English is so biased against this that it's almost impossible to translate this into English</p> <p>without turning it passive. It's not passive in Japanese.</p> <p>And this bias goes so deep that the entire <code>-\u308c\u308b/-</code>\u3089\u308c\u308b<code></code> helper verb, which is the verb of receiving an action, is called <code>the passive</code> by this pseudo-Japanese grammar that gets taught in English.</p> <p>It's not passive -- it's just that the only way to translate it into English is to turn it passive.</p> <p>Now, let's get back to our crepes.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u304c\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044</code>, the center of the action is the crepes.</p> <p>They are inducing desire in me.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u304a\u8179\u304c\u7a7a\u3044\u305f\u3001 (zero\u304c)  \u65e9\u304f\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044</code>, we're saying <code>I'm hungry; I want to eat soon.</code></p> <p>Now, <code>\u65e9\u304f\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044</code> doesn't have a visible actor, but the actor of this - the zero - is <code>me</code>,</p> <p>so it's <code>(zero\u304c) \u65e9\u304f\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044</code> -- <code>I want to eat soon.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, this is the final problem.</p> <p>This is the thing that some of my most astute students have reacted against.</p> <p>They don't like the fact that the <code>-\u305f\u3044</code> helper adjective switches polarity, that it can both</p> <p>describe something inducing the desire to eat and the person feeling the desire to eat if the inducer is not explicitly present. (If confusing, check Lesson 9c about \u305f\u3044)</p> <p>They actually have suggested -- and several people have suggested this to me independently --</p> <p>have suggested the work-around of saying <code>Well, can't we say that the \u304c-marked actor is in fact food? Just food in general perhaps: 'Food is making me want to eat it.'</code></p> <p>And I see why they're trying to do this.</p> <p>They're trying to get rid of what looks like the one anomaly in an otherwise perfectly logical system.</p> <p>But actually this isn't an anomaly, and we'll come to that in a moment.</p> <p>The work-around doesn't work, firstly because if you know much about Japanese you understand that this is not what's happening.</p> <p>Someone is not saying they're wanting to eat anything or food in general,</p> <p>they're just saying that they want to eat.</p> <p>That's something I think you'll intuitively come to understand,</p> <p>but I also understand that intuition is not an argument.</p> <p>Even Genki could probably use the intuition card to support some of their rather outlandish</p> <p>interpretations of Japanese.</p> <p>But we don't have to rely on that. We can produce proof.</p> <p>Let's take the sentence <code> (zero\u304c)  \u6771\u4eac\u306b\u884c\u304d\u305f\u3044.</code></p> <p>This means <code>I want to go to Tokyo.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, there is no possible other <code>zero\u304c</code> in this sentence than <code>I</code>.</p> <p>It can't be Tokyo, because that's already the \u306b-marked destination.</p> <p>It can't be <code>go</code> because that's a verb and we can never mark anything but a noun</p> <p>with \u304c or any other logical particle.</p> <p>So we know for certain that it is in fact possible for <code>-\u305f\u3044</code> to flip its polarity,</p> <p>to point not to the object inducing desire to do but also to the person or animal experiencing the desire to do.</p> <p>And this goes on to extend to other areas of Japanese.</p> <p>For example, the potential.</p> <p>When we say <code>\u672c\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u308b</code>, we're saying <code>The book does readable.</code></p> <p></p> <p>We can't translate this directly into English because it's a verb and <code>readable</code> isn't a verb in English, but in Japanese we're saying <code>The book does readable.</code></p> <p>Now this is the subjectivity in a certain sense because it's not talking about the fact</p> <p>that it's in general possible to read the book. That would be <code>\u53ef\u80fd\u6027/\u304b\u306e\u3046\u305b\u3044</code>.</p> <p>It's talking about the fact that the book is readable to a person or people in particular.</p> <p>But again, the \u304c-marked subject is the book.</p> <p>So saying <code>I can read the book</code> or <code>We can read the book</code> is simply false.</p> <p>That's not what the sentence is doing and if we think it is, we're going to end up with</p> <p>this completely destructive idea that \u304c can sometimes mark the object of a sentence. It never can. It can only ever mark the subject, the A-car of a sentence.</p> <p>And this is so crucial to Japanese because it's what every single sentence you ever see,</p> <p>ever in your whole life, consists of: a \u304c-marked A-[car] and a B-engine.</p> <p>Disrupt that and you've disrupted everything.</p> <p>So, the actor of <code>\u672c\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u308b</code> is the book: <code>The book does readable.</code></p> <p>But if we say <code>\u79c1\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u308b</code> or <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u308b</code>,</p> <p>what we're saying is <code>I can read</code>/ <code>Sakura can read.</code></p> <p>Not can read a particular book, not can read a newspaper,</p> <p>not can read a manga, but can read, is literate.</p> <p>So, once again, the potential can flip its polarity.</p> <p>If there's a specific readable thing, then it's that that <code>does readable</code>, but if there isn't,</p> <p>if it's just referring to literacy in general, then it flips polarity</p> <p>and points to the person or people who are able to read.</p> <p>Now why is this? We've talked about the fact that the non-egocentricity of Japanese is fundamentally rooted in a more animist way of seeing the world.</p> <p>I'm not saying anything here about what Japanese people as individuals believe nowadays.</p> <p>I'm talking about how the language looks at the world.</p> <p>English requires an ego at the center; Japanese doesn't.</p> <p>It's much more happy to have non-ego actors as the center of even a subjective-based sentence.</p> <p>But it doesn't stop there.</p> <p>And once you realize that, we've done away with the final problem.</p> <p>It's not just that it doesn't find having a non-ego actor at the center and that in many cases</p> <p>it has a preference for that, it's also that it sees the two, the inducer of the subjectivity and the receiver, the experiencer, of the subjectivity, as not fundamentally separate.</p> <p>The action of subjectively desiring or fearing or wanting etc. is something that goes on</p> <p>between the two, between the inducer and the experiencer.</p> <p>And we can look at it from either perspective and it doesn't really matter.</p> <p>The bias, as it were, the default condition, is to attribute it to the inducer,</p> <p>but there's no difficulty at all in moving it to the experiencer.</p> <p>Because the two aren't regarded as completely separate.</p> <p>They are two halves of the same action.</p> <p>And if we understand this, we're looking at it much more through Japanese eyes.</p> <p>We're not having to re-route it through strange English intermediaries.</p> <p>And this affects all kinds of things, not just the grammatical areas we've talked about,</p> <p>but all kinds of things. For example, let's take the word <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70</code>. <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70</code> means <code>mystery</code>.</p> <p>It's a noun, it means <code>mystery</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And it can be used as an adjectival noun, in which case it means something like <code>mysterious</code>.</p> <p>So if we say <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u5c4b\u6577</code>, we're saying <code>mysterious mansion</code>.</p> <p>But we can also attach <code>\u305d\u3046</code> to <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70</code>, which, as we've discussed before, means <code>seems</code> or <code>like</code>.</p> <p>So <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u305d\u3046</code> would seem to mean <code>seems mysterious</code> or <code>mysterious-like</code>.</p> <p>Now, this in itself is meaningless, because <code>mysterious</code> is a subjectivity.</p> <p>If we say something is mysterious, this isn't an objective quality like being red or being three feet high. It's a subjectivity. It's mysterious because we find it mysterious.</p> <p>If we don't find it mysterious, then it's not mysterious.</p> <p>So saying it's mysterious-like or seems mysterious is meaningless because</p> <p>saying it's mysterious in the first place is really only saying that.</p> <p>But that isn't what <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u305d\u3046</code> means.</p> <p><code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u305d\u3046</code> is used in sentences like <code>\u300c\u3053\u308c\u306f\u306a\u30fc\u306b\uff1f\u300d\u3068\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u305d\u3046\u306b\u8a00\u3063\u305f</code> --</p> <p><code>Whats this?' asked Sakura in a mystified manner.</code></p> <p><code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u305d\u3046</code>, you see, again flips polarity.</p> <p>It doesn't apply to the thing which is inducing the sense of mystery,</p> <p>it applies to the person feeling the sense of mystery.</p> <p>So <code>\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u305d\u3046</code> means something like <code>mystified</code>, sometimes perhaps <code>puzzled</code>, but in any case it means <code>perceiving quality of \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70 in something else</code>.</p> <p>So you see this whole flipping of polarity, which is based in a more unified view of the world,</p> <p>not just more <code>animist</code>, to use that term, but unified.</p> <p>More in a sense that the inside and the outside are not wholly separate</p> <p>but are two sides of the same perception.</p> <p>And if we can grasp that, the final problem is solved and</p> <p>a whole area of Japanese is unlocked and released from the necessity of routing it through English.</p> <p>::: info As usual, if this lesson feels confusing or complex, I recommend looking into the comments of the video where Dolly discusses some stuff in more depth. :::</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/44-how-to-use-natural-japanese-%E3%81%A1%E3%82%83%E3%81%86-%E3%81%A1%E3%82%83%E3%81%A3%E3%81%9F/","title":"44.

40),</p> <p>if the \u3066-form is <code>\u3067</code> then instead of becoming <code>-\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f</code>, it becomes <code>-\u3058\u3083\u3063\u305f</code>, just in the way that <code>\u3067\u306f</code> becomes <code>\u3058\u3083</code>.</p> <p>Now, this has a much wider range of meanings than just <code>\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f</code> on its own.</p> <p>It can be used for things that we did by accident or that we wish we hadn't done.</p> <p>For example, we often say <code>\u5fd8\u308c\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f</code>, which is <code>\u5fd8\u308c\u308b</code> -- <code>forget</code> -- plus <code>-\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p>There's a famous song <code>\u30cd\u30b3\u8e0f\u3093\u3058\u3083\u3063\u305f</code>, which is great fun, and I'll put a link in the information section below.</p> <p>And what that means is <code>I trod on the cat</code>: <code>\u8e0f\u3080</code> -- to <code>tread (on something)</code>.</p> <p>So we can see that it has a negative sense here, but it can also be something very good.</p> <p>We might say <code>\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f</code> -- <code>I became a superhero.</code></p> <p>So what do these things have in common?</p> <p>Accidental things, things we regret, things we're very pleased about.</p> <p>The way I would put this, the way I would translate this into English, because this</p> <p>is the English expression that I think covers practically all cases of <code>-\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f</code>, is the word <code>done</code>.</p> <p><code>\u5fd8\u308c\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f</code> -- <code>I done forgot</code>; <code>\u732b\u8e0f\u3093\u3058\u3083\u3063\u305f</code> -- <code>I done trod on the cat</code>;</p> <p><code>\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f</code> -- <code>I done became a superhero.</code></p> <p>In all these cases , the idea is very similar.</p> <p>We're saying that it happened, it's done, it's completed, it's a fact, and the implication generally speaking is that we didn't expect it to be a fact or it wasn't what most people would normally have expected to be a fact, but it is. It <code>done happened</code>.</p> <p>And if we understand that, it's very easy to understand all the different kinds of circumstances under which <code>-\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f</code> gets used.</p> <p>The only real difference between this and <code>done</code> in English is that we don't only use it about past things. We also use it about future things.</p> <p>So we can say, <code>\u590f\u4f11\u307f\u304c\u7d42\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046</code> and that means <code>the summer vacation will done end</code>.</p> <p>Now, of course you can't say that in English but that essentially is what you're saying.</p> <p>It will just be and go and end.</p> <p>That's what'll happen and it'll be done and there's nothing we'll be able to do about it.</p> <p>If you're about to tell somebody something embarrassing, you might say</p> <p><code>\u541b\u306e\u306f\u7b11\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3046\u3060\u308d\u3046</code> -- <code>You'll probably laugh</code></p> <p>or <code>You'll probably done laugh / You'll probably just up and laugh.</code></p> <p>Again, it's the same idea but in Japanese we can project that idea into the future as well.</p> <p>We can say <code>\u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093\u98f2\u3093\u3058\u3083\u3046</code>, and that's <code>Today, I'm going to drink like crazy</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093</code> is <code>one after another in rapid succession</code>; <code>\u98f2\u3093\u3058\u3083\u3046</code> is <code>done drink</code>.</p> <p>Again, we can't put that in the future in English, but we can put it in the future in Japanese.</p> <p>So if we understand how these work, we don't have to have a lot of complicated explanations</p> <p>of all their different cases.</p> <p>They work in the same way all the time if we only think about what is the way they work</p> <p>rather than what their end result is if you translate it into English.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/45-first-step-guide-into-self-immersion-technique/","title":"45. First-Step Guide into Self Immersion Technique","text":"<p>Japanese Immersion. First-Step Guide into Self Immersion Technique | Lesson 45</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today, we're going to take the plunge from abstract theoretical Japanese -- grammar and structure and vocabulary \u2013 into actual direct immersion in real Japanese material for Japanese people.</p> <p>As you know, I recommend doing this at the earliest stage possible, but it's pretty difficult,</p> <p>because once you're in real Japanese material you're going to encounter vocabulary that</p> <p>you didn't know before even in very simple material, because small Japanese children</p> <p>have a huge vocabulary compared even to foreigners who've taken quite high-level Japanese exams.</p> <p>This is why I don't recommend core vocabulary decks and things like that.</p> <p>The way to pick up core vocabulary beyond a small base is to pick it up as you proceed</p> <p>through real Japanese material.</p> <p>That way you get the kind of vocabulary you're actually going to be encountering and using.</p> <p>So what I'm going to do is take a simple Japanese story that's not in any way doctored for foreigners. It's just the way it is.</p> <p>And it also has audio and I'll link you to that in the Comments below.</p> <p>So once we've gone through the story and you've got it clear in your mind,</p> <p>you can put the audio onto your phone or your mp3 player and hear it over and over again. That's going to consolidate any new vocabulary; it's going to consolidate the rhythm and spoken form of Japanese and the structure, because we need to move structure and vocabulary from the abstract area, where you know them but you have to think about them very carefully to do anything, into the area where it starts to become instinctive.</p> <p></p> <p>So please, use that audio once we've been through the story.</p> <p>It's very short, and I'm going to make a page, which I'll link below, where I give the links</p> <p>to the various videos where I talk about the grammar points that we encounter.</p> <p>You're going to see that even in a short and simple story like this,</p> <p>we use a lot of the structure that we encounter in my various lessons.</p> <p>All right, so let's get started.</p> <p>This is a short and simple fable about a greedy dog.</p> <p>And the first sentence is: <code>\u8089\u3092\u304f\u308f\u3048\u305f\u72ac\u304c\u306f\u3057\u3092\u308f\u305f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f.</code></p> <p></p> <p>So you see this is in \u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059-style Japanese, so if you're a little bit uncertain about that</p> <p>please refer to my \u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059 video.</p> <p><code>\u8089\u3092\u304f\u308f\u3048\u305f\u72ac\u304c.</code></p> <p>Now, <code>\u8089</code> means <code>meat</code> and <code>\u304f\u308f\u3048\u308b</code> means <code>hold in one's mouth</code>.</p> <p>It's one of those words that you could do a huge core deck and still not know.</p> <p>And what's happening here is that very common technique of inverting a simple logical clause\u3000to turn it into a descriptive clause.</p> <p></p> <p>So, <code>\u72ac\u304c\u8089\u3092\u304f\u308f\u3048\u305f</code> is <code>a dog held meat in its mouth</code>, but <code>\u8089\u3092\u304f\u308f\u3048\u305f\u72ac</code></p> <p>is <code>a dog that was holding meat in its mouth</code>.</p> <p>So, that dog is the subject of our sentence, marked with \u304c.</p> <p><code>\u8089\u3092\u304f\u308f\u3048\u305f\u72ac\u304c\u306f\u3057\u3092\u308f\u305f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f.</code></p> <p><code>\u6a4b/\u306f\u3057</code> is <code>bridge</code> and <code>\u308f\u305f\u308b</code> is <code>cross</code>.</p> <p>So, the dog was in the process (<code>-\u3066\u3044\u308b</code>) of crossing the bridge.</p> <p><code>\u8089\u3092\u304f\u308f\u3048\u305f\u72ac\u304c\u306f\u3057\u3092\u308f\u305f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f.</code></p> <p>So that set the scene.</p> <p>We know what's happening.</p> <p><code>\u3075\u3068\u4e0b\u3092\u898b\u308b\u3068\u3001\u5ddd\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u3082\u8089\u3092\u304f\u308f\u3048\u305f\u72ac\u304c\u3044\u307e\u3059.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, the first thing to notice here is that this second sentence is in the non-past tense, isn't it?</p> <p>So this is a difference between Japanese narrative convention and English.</p> <p>In English narrative, if the narrative is in the past tense it stays in the past tense</p> <p>and every sentence is in the past tense.</p> <p>In Japanese narrative this isn't the case.</p> <p>We can set a narrative in the past tense but sometimes when we want to give more immediacy to something, we just move into the present tense.</p> <p>This is not allowable in English narrative, but it's perfectly allowable in Japanese narrative, so we need to be aware of that and not let it confuse us.</p> <p>So, what's going on here?</p> <p><code>\u3075\u3068</code> means <code>suddenly</code> -- I'm not going to explain the simplest vocabulary here because</p> <p>I'll assume that you've got very basic vocabulary in order to start making the plunge into Japanese narrative.</p> <p>So, <code>\u3075\u3068</code> means <code>suddenly</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3075\u3068\u4e0b\u3092\u898b\u308b\u3068</code> -- <code>(the dog) suddenly looked down</code>.</p> <p>The zero-pronoun here is <code>it</code>, the dog.</p> <p>So, the dog suddenly looked down, and that <code>\u3068</code> is the conditional connective,</p> <p><code>if</code> or <code>when</code>, and I'll link to that (Lesson 30).</p> <p>So it's saying <code>When the dog suddenly looked down...</code> or <code>The dog suddenly looked down, and...</code></p> <p><code>When the dog suddenly looked down... \u5ddd\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u3082</code>.</p> <p><code>\u5ddd\u306e\u4e2d\u306b</code> is <code>in the river</code> and the <code>\u3082</code> here is telling us <code>also</code>: <code>also in the river</code>.</p> <p><code>\u5ddd\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u3082\u8089\u3092\u304f\u308f\u3048\u305f\u72ac\u304c\u3044\u307e\u3059.</code></p> <p>So, <code>also in the river there's a dog carrying meat in its mouth</code>.</p> <p>Not just on the bridge but also in the river, there's a dog carrying meat in its mouth.</p> <p><code>\u72ac\u306f\u305d\u308c\u3092\u898b\u3066\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f.</code></p> <p>Now, the dog is now being referred to with \u306f rather than \u304c, and that's because</p> <p>we've now had the dog introduced, so it's no longer <code>a dog</code>, it's <code>the dog</code>.</p> <p>And I'll link to the video where I explained this.</p> <p><code>\u72ac\u306f\u305d\u308c\u3092\u898b\u3066</code>; <code>\u305d\u308c</code> is <code>that</code> and so this is the first part of a compound sentence:</p> <p><code>The dog saw that and..</code> -- the \u3066-form is giving us the <code>and</code> there.</p> <p></p> <p>And I'll link to compound sentences (Lesson 4).</p> <p>I'm going to stop telling you now what I'm linking to,

in other words,</p> <p>in comparison to one's own things, their things appear good.</p> <p>So the first moral is: Even though it's the same thing, something that other people have can appear better.</p> <p>And that's the first moral.</p> <p>In English, we'd probably put that the other way around and say,</p> <p><code>Other people's things appear better than ours, but in fact they're the same.</code></p> <p><code>\u307e\u305f</code> -- <code>\u307e\u305f</code> means <code>again</code> or in cases like this it means <code>also</code>.</p> <p>So, also the second moral is: <code>\u6b32\u5f35\u308b\u3068\u3051\u3063\u304d\u3087\u304f\u640d\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u304a\u8a71\u3067\u3059.</code></p> <p><code>\u6b32\u5f35\u308b</code> is to <code>be selfish / to be full of glittery, to be full of desires and wants</code> --<code>\u6b32\u5f35\u308b</code>.</p> <p><code>\u6b32\u5f35\u308b\u3068</code> is again this connective if-or-when <code>\u3068</code>;

Isn't Japanese really a Subject-Object-Verb language?</p> <p>No, it isn't.</p> <p>Because although <code>\u30e1\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u30b9\u30fc\u30b6\u30f3\u3092\u306a\u3050\u3063\u305f</code> is the most common way of putting it,</p> <p>it isn't the only way of putting it.</p> <p>We could just as easily say <code>\u30b9\u30fc\u30b6\u30f3\u3092\u30e1\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u306a\u3050\u3063\u305f</code> and we're still saying <code>Mary hit Susan</code>, even though we've changed the order.</p> <p></p> <p>Because in Japanese the question of who did what to whom and most other logical questions like where it was done, what it was done with, and all those things are handled by logical particles.</p> <p>So the important thing in this sentence is not which order we have Mary and Susan</p> <p>but which one is marked by \u304c and which one is marked by \u3092.</p> <p>So this talk of a Subject-Object-Verb language is nonsense.</p> <p>It doesn't actually matter which order you put them in.</p> <p>And this of course is the basis of these people who say Japanese word order doesn't matter.</p> <p>So aren't they right?</p> <p>No, they're not right.</p> <p>Because Japanese word order does matter.</p> <p>It just doesn't matter in the same ways and the same places that European word order matters.</p> <p>If we start thinking about Japanese as Japanese and not trying to interpret it as a European language, then we can make some progress on actually understanding Japanese.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/46-word-order-matters-2-simple-rules-to-crack-tough-sentences/#japanese-word-order-rules","title":"Japanese word order rules","text":"<p>So what is Japanese word order and why does it matter so much?</p> <p>Japanese word order goes according to two simple rules.

We're talking about nouns at the moment.</p> <p>And by <code>anything</code>, I really mean anything.</p> <p>It could be a logical clause, it could be part of a logical clause, it could be another noun --</p> <p>it's anything that modifies any noun.</p> <p>So what do I mean by <code>modify</code>?</p> <p>Well, I mean literally changing something or, we could say, describing it.</p> <p>So if we have a dress and then we put a modifier before it and say it's a <code>blue dress</code>,</p> <p>then we've modified it -- we've made it blue.</p> <p></p> <p>If we say it's a <code>big dress</code> then we've modified it and made it big.</p> <p>If we say it's a <code>hot dress</code> then we've modified it and made it hot.</p> <p>And of course modifiers can become more complex than that and we'll talk about that in just a moment.</p> <p>But a modifier is something that tells us more about a noun.</p> <p>It modifies it from just being the simple noun to being a more particular version of that noun.</p> <p>So what do I mean by saying that <code>Anything that modifies any-thing must come before it</code>?</p> <p>Well, if we speak English we should be used to this idea already, because in English simple modifiers always come before the noun they modify.</p> <p>So, as we've just seen, if we say <code>a blue dress</code>, <code>blue</code> comes before the modified noun <code>dress</code>, the noun that we've just turned blue.</p> <p>We say <code>a warm day</code>. <code>Warm</code> comes before the noun <code>day</code>. And it can become more complex.</p> <p>We might say <code>a pale blue dress</code>, <code>a nice warm day</code>, and the modifier still comes before the noun it's modifying.</p> <p>And it can get more complicated still.</p> <p>We might say <code>an interesting-looking pale blue dress</code>,</p> <p>and all of it still comes before the noun <code>dress</code>, doesn't it?</p> <p></p> <p>However, when modifiers become more complex in English</p> <p>we start throwing them on the other side of the noun.</p> <p>So if we want to say <code>the dress I bought at the market on Saturday</code>,</p> <p>now <code>dress</code> comes first and the modifier comes afterward.</p> <p>And sometimes we're throwing modifiers onto both sides of the noun.</p> <p>So we might say, <code>the pale blue dress I bought at the market yesterday</code>.</p> <p>So we've got <code>dress</code> sandwiched in the middle and clauses modifying that dress on both sides of it.</p> <p>That's not the way Japanese works.</p> <p>Japanese always keeps modifiers before the thing they modify.</p> <p>So it's very predictable and we always know what's going on.</p> <p>A way of looking at Japanese word order is to see it as a stage scene.</p> <p>To see every sentence or every logical clause as a little scene on a stage.</p> <p>And the way Japanese works is that first of all it dresses the little dolls that go into the scene.</p> <p>So before each doll comes whatever it's dressed in, whatever modifies it, whatever tells us more about it, its clothes, its setting. Then we put it on the stage.</p> <p>We mark it with whatever part it plays in the sentence,</p> <p>and then we put the next noun if there is another noun,</p> <p>and finally we put on the action button, the verb.</p> <p>And we always press the action button last.</p> <p></p> <p>So this is the order of Japanese sentences.</p> <p>First of all, the information about the actors.</p> <p>Then the actors themselves.</p> <p>And if there's more than one actor, we put its information first and then the actor,</p> <p>and the next one we put its information first and then the actor.</p> <p>And then finally, if it's an action scene, if it's an <code>A does B</code> scene, then we put on the action button and we watch the actors going through their parts.</p> <p>And from the word order we can always tell what's happening.</p> <p>If we have a clause that ends in one of the Engines, a Verb, an Adjective or a Noun plus Copula, we know that that is a logical clause.</p> <p></p> <p>But if it's turned around in any way, if it's ending in a noun and not in an Engine,</p> <p>then we know that the noun at the head of that clause is a modified noun</p> <p>and the clause is not functioning as a logical clause.</p> <p>Let's take the example we've been looking at.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3067 (zero\u304c) \u9752\u3044\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code>, we're saying <code>I bought a blue dress at the market.</code></p> <p></p> <p>And we know that that's a logical clause because of Rule One.</p> <p>So this is a logical clause ending with an Engine.</p> <p>It's an <code>A does B</code> clause: <code>I bought a blue dress at the market.</code></p> <p>Now, we can move almost any element from a logical clause to the front of the clause,</p> <p>that's to say, to the position nearest the Engine,</p> <p>furthest right in horizontal text, furthest down in vertical text.</p> <p>We can move it to the head of the clause</p> <p>and if we do that, if we move any non-Engine element to the head of the clause,</p> <p>then it's no longer functioning as a logical clause, but it's functioning as</p> <p>a modifier for that element that we've moved to the head.</p> <p>So, if we say, <code>\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3067 (zero\u304c) \u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9</code>, we're saying <code>the dress I bought at the market</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>This is no longer a logical clause. It's a modified noun, and the noun is the dress.</p> <p>Now, we can just as easily bring the market to the head of the clause.</p> <p>We can say, <code> (zero\u304c) \u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u3044\u3061\u3070</code>, and now we're saying <code>the market at which I bought the dress</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And again, we know this isn't a logical clause because it doesn't have an Engine at the head.</p> <p>At the head it has a noun, and so that noun must be modified by what is going before it.</p> <p>And since it's not a logical clause, in order to make a logical clause we have to have something else after it.</p> <p>And that again could contain modifications.</p> <p>Because Japanese does things with these modifications that</p> <p>in other languages are done in other ways.</p> <p>So almost any complex Japanese sentence is going to be heavily dependent on these premodifiers.</p> <p>And knowing what is modifying, what is being modified, knowing whether something is a modified noun or whether we're looking at a logical clause -- all this is dependent on word order.</p> <p>So, the full clause here might be: <code> (zero\u304c) \u3044\u3061\u3070\u3067\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u3092\u304b\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5c11\u5973\u306b\u3042\u3052\u305f.</code></p> <p></p> <p>So then we're saying, <code>I gave the dress that I bought at the market to a girl wearing glasses.</code></p> <p>And once again, we have what could be a logical clause -- <code>\u5c11\u5973\u306f\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u3092\u304b\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b</code>,</p> <p><code>The girl is wearing glasses</code> -- but we've taken the noun <code>\u5c11\u5973</code> -- <code>girl</code> -- to the front,</p> <p>so now it's not a logical clause, it's a noun with a modifier,</p> <p>the girl (\u5c11\u5973) modified by the phrase <code>\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u3092\u304b\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b</code> -- <code>girl wearing glasses</code>.</p> <p><code>I gave the dress I bought at the market to a girl wearing glasses.</code></p> <p>And this is very typical.</p> <p>You're going to see this kind of construction all the time.</p> <p>The way Japanese does an awful lot of the work of conveying things is by using these modifying clauses, which always come before whatever it is they're modifying.</p> <p>First of all we dress the doll, then we put the doll on the stage, then we press the action button.</p> <p>So, word order is crucial to understanding Japanese\u2026</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/47-how-to-understand-japanese-your-secret-weapon-for-breaking-down-sentences/","title":"47. How to Understand Japanese: Your Secret Weapon for breaking down sentences","text":"<p>How to Understand Japanese: Your Secret Weapon for breaking down sentences | Lesson 47</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to talk about the secret weapon that will allow you to grasp any Japanese sentence regardless of how complex it may appear to be.</p> <p>A lot of Japanese sentences in fact appear much more complicated than they really are</p> <p>because of what I call the modular or modification structure of the language.</p> <p>But once we understand how it really works this structure stops being our enemy</p> <p>and becomes our friend, because it allows us to break down any complicated Japanese sentence into something that's really laughably simple.</p> <p>I told you right from the beginning of this course that every Japanese sentence consists of two elements, and they are the A-car (the subject) and the B-engine.</p> <p></p> <p>The A-car is always marked by \u304c.</p> <p>We can't always see it, but whether we can see it or not, it's always logically there</p> <p>and it's always marked by \u304c.</p> <p>The B-engine can be one of only three things.</p> <p>It can be a verb, an adjective, or a noun-plus-copula <code>\u3060</code> or <code>\u3067\u3059</code>.</p> <p>There are only two kinds of sentences: <code>A is B</code> and <code>A does B</code> sentences.</p> <p>In an <code>A does B</code> sentence, A is the thing that does B, which is the engine, which has to be a verb.</p> <p>In an <code>A is B</code> sentence, A is the thing which is B, which has to be an adjective or a noun-plus-copula.</p> <p>Now, we've seen much more complicated sentences since then and we've seen how every one of them has this same A and B as its fundamental core.</p> <p>But the important thing we are going to look at today</p> <p>is the fact that A and B are not just the core of the sentence: they are the sentence.</p> <p>Everything else is doing nothing other than telling us something more about A or something more about B.</p> <p>Now, the only other thing that can complicate this at times is the fact that</p> <p>when we say <code>a sentence</code> what we actually mean is a logical clause.</p> <p>Now, we sometimes use those two terms interchangeably</p> <p>and we very often can use them interchangeably,</p> <p>but the difference is this: a logical clause is by definition a complete sentence,</p> <p>that's to say, we could put a <code>\u25cb / \u307e\u308b</code> or a period at the end of it and then it's a sentence.</p> <p>It can stand on its own; it's grammatical; it doesn't need anything else. It is a sentence.</p> <p>But the reason we call it <code>a logical clause</code> is because a sentence can contain more than one logical clause.</p> <p>That's to say, it can contain within itself two elements that could each be a complete sentence.</p> <p>Now, a very simple example of this is if we say <code> (zero\u304c) \u304a\u5e97\u306b\u884c\u3063\u3066 (zero\u304c) \u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code>,</p> <p>which in English is <code>I went to the shops and bought bread.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, in both English and Japanese, this is two logical clauses made into one compound sentence.</p> <p>And I've talked about compound sentences in another video.</p> <p>So what we have here is the logical clause <code> (zero\u304c) \u304a\u5e97\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f</code> -- <code>I went to the shops</code> --</p> <p>and <code> (zero\u304c) \u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code> -- <code>I bought bread</code>.</p> <p>In English this is <code>I went to the shops and I bought bread</code>.</p> <p>Now, in Japanese we don't need to have the <code>I</code> visible but it has to be logically there</p> <p>and it logically carries the particle \u304c.</p> <p>We sometimes say that English requires the subject to be visibly present in every clause,</p> <p>but this isn't actually true, although it's close to being true.</p> <p>And this is an example of how it isn't always true.</p> <p>English actually does use the zero pronoun just as Japanese does.</p> <p>It just doesn't do it nearly so often.</p> <p>So with this sentence in English we don't normally say <code>I went to the shops and I bought some bread</code>.</p> <p>We usually say <code>I went to the shops and bought some bread</code>.</p> <p>So you see here that English is actually using the zero pronoun.</p> <p>We don't have to say <code>I</code> twice.</p> <p>We're allowed to carry it over from context to the second clause of the sentence</p> <p>just the way Japanese much more freely allows us to do that.</p> <p>But in all cases the subject is there.</p> <p>Bread isn't buying itself. I'm buying it, whether I am visibly there as the subject or not.</p> <p>So one skill that we need for understanding a complex sentence is the ability to see</p> <p>where logical clauses end, to see when something is in fact a complete logical clause</p> <p>with its own A-car and B-engine.</p> <p>And I've done a whole video explaining how to do that,</p> <p>so you may want to watch that video after you see this one. (Lesson 34)</p> <p>Today we're going to concentrate on the logical clause</p> <p>and the ways in which it can apparently become complicated.</p> <p>Last week we were talking about the concept of modifiers and we were talking about it</p> <p>in its perhaps simplest and most approachable form, which is noun modifiers.</p> <p>And to understand modifiers you have to understand word order in Japanese</p> <p>because Japanese word order is extremely important. As sentences become more complex, you have to understand word order to understand what they're doing.</p> <p>So these people who tell you that Japanese has no set word order or that Japanese is an SOV language are really leading you up the garden path because neither of those statements is true, as we discussed last week. (Lesson 46)</p> <p>So the first law of Japanese word order is that the engine of the sentence,</p> <p>which can be a verb, an adjective or a noun-plus-copula, always has to come at the end of the sentence.</p> <p></p> <p>And the second law, and this is the most important one for our present purposes, is that</p> <p>anything that modifies anything has to come before it.</p> <p>Now, last week, the form I put this in was <code>Anything that modifies any *THING* has to come before it</code>, that's to say, anything that modifies a noun has to come before that noun.</p> <p>But we can take this further, and that's what we're going to do this week.</p> <p>And we can simply say <code>Anything that modifies ANYTHING always comes BEFORE it</code>.</p> <p>It doesn't have to be a noun.</p> <p>What else could it be?</p> <p>Well, it could be the head verb of the sentence.</p> <p>So, let's go back to a somewhat complex sentence that we analyzed last week.</p> <p><code> (zero\u304c) \u3044\u3061\u3070\u3067\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u3092\u304b\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5c11\u5973\u306b\u3042\u3052\u305f.</code></p> <p>-- <code>I gave the dress I bought at the market to a girl wearing glasses.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, I colored this in order to show the process of noun modification.</p> <p>In this sentence we have the A-car, which is invisible (it's \"I****, zero\u304c),</p> <p>and we have the engine, which is <code>\u3042\u3052\u305f</code>.</p> <p>And that is the sentence core: <code>I gave</code>.</p> <p>Now, inside the sentence we have two nouns and they're both modified by more information. And in both cases that information is given by taking a logical clause and pulling out one element and putting it at the head of the sentence, at the engine end of the sentence.</p> <p>So we could say <code>\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3067 (zero\u304c) \u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code> and then we have the engine at the end and we're saying <code>I bought a dress at the market</code>,</p> <p>but we can also pull out any element from that sentence and put it at the end and that becomes a modified noun.</p> <p>So we can say, as we're saying here, <code>\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3067 (zero\u304c) \u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9</code>, which means <code>the dress I bought at the market</code>.</p> <p>We could also do the same thing with the market: <code> (zero\u304c) \u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u3044\u3061\u3070</code></p> <p>-- <code>the market at which I bought the dress</code>.</p> <p>And neither of these is a logical clause, because it couldn't stand on its own as a sentence, could it?</p> <p>It's now a noun which has to play some role in a larger sentence.</p> <p>So, the blue elements here are the modifiers,</p> <p>the red elements are nouns that are marked with logical particles. (the last picture still)</p> <p>And here is this fundamental radical fact that you need to take a moment to ingest.</p> <p>In an <code>A does B</code> sentence, the nouns marked by the main logical particles other than \u304c,</p> <p>that is, by \u3092, \u306b, \u3067, and \u3078, are all modifiers for the verb.</p> <p>The logical particle \u304c tells us what the subject of the sentence is, what the A-car is.</p> <p>The logical particle \u306e is an exception here because what it does is couple two nouns.</p> <p>But the main verb-sentence logical particles, \u3092, \u306b, \u3067, and \u3078, do one thing and one thing only.</p> <p>They modify the verb; they tell us more about it.</p> <p></p> <p>So in this sentence, the sentence itself is <code>I gave</code>, and then these modified nouns provide</p> <p>more information about that verb <code>gave</code>.</p> <p>::: info - I\u2019ll give the direct Japanese sentence examples here, but take them with a grain of salt.

Lesson 48</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to talk about ambiguity in Japanese,</p> <p>because this is something that makes the language</p> <p>much harder to understand for many non-Japanese learners.</p> <p>Now, Japanese has a reputation for being an ambiguous language.</p> <p>And whether this is true or not, the perception of ambiguity makes sentences harder to understand.</p> <p>So, I want to look at real and perceived ambiguity in Japanese and how to deal with it.</p> <p>Japanese people don't have any difficulty in understanding each other,</p> <p>and there's no reason for you to have any difficulty either.</p> <p>A lot of the perceived difficulty comes from the fact that it's taught in such a way as not to explain the real structure of the language.</p> <p>So let's look at some different aspects of real and perceived Japanese ambiguity.</p> <p>Probably the first thing that makes Japanese feel ambiguous and difficult to foreigners</p> <p>is the zero pronoun.</p> <p></p> <p>It's so confusing to many people that there are intelligent and respectable teachers of Japanese</p> <p>on the Web who even go so far as to claim that Japanese has no grammatical subject.</p> <p>It certainly has a grammatical subject and it's present in every sentence.</p> <p>The thing is that you can't always see it.</p> <p>Now, I've explained before that this is really that the Japanese invisible pronoun</p> <p>(or zero pronoun) is no more confusing than English <code>it</code>.</p> <p>The word <code>it</code> could mean the Andromeda galaxy, it could mean a tree, it could mean my kneecap (I do have kneecaps), it could mean a chimpanzee's tail, assuming chimpanzees do have tails, and even if they don't it could be an imaginary chimpanzee's tail.</p> <p>The point is that because <code>it</code> can mean just about everything, it actually means nothing except in context.</p> <p>And that's exactly how the zero pronoun works.</p> <p>And one is no more ambiguous than the other.</p> <p>But some people are going to say,</p> <p><code>But the fact that you can't see it means that we don't even know whether it's there or not.</code></p> <p>And the answer to that is that yes, we can know.</p> <p>So long as we understand the structure of the language, we know it's there because it has to be there.</p> <p>It's logically there.</p> <p>So there's no difficulty at all about pinpointing the zero pronoun</p> <p>provided we understand the structure of the language.</p> <p>And one of the difficulties of course is that conventional Japanese grammar textbooks and websites don't teach the real structure of the language and so they leave us in doubt on this as on many other subjects.</p> <p></p> <p>But that's what my course is for, so if you follow my course or have followed my course</p> <p>you should be clear enough about the structure of the language.</p> <p>So, can the zero pronoun ever cause ambiguity?</p> <p>Yes, it can. Just as <code>it</code> can in English.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, if I say, <code>My right antenna was so broken that it fell off</code></p> <p>(you haven't seen my antennae, have you? Well, they're a bit of a secret, so let's pass on)</p> <p><code>My right antenna was so broken that it fell off</code>,</p> <p>you know from context that <code>it</code> refers to my right antenna.</p> <p>But suppose I say, <code>I was trying to fix the door handle, but my right antenna was so broken that it fell off.</code></p> <p>Then you may not know whether I mean that my right antenna fell off or that the door handle fell off.</p> <p>And this kind of ambiguity can occur in any language, and really no more in Japanese than any other language.</p> <p>What do we do about it when it does occur?</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/48-dealing-with-ambiguity-in-japanese/#the-context-rule","title":"The Context Rule","text":"<p>Well, fundamentally it's up to the speaker to make herself clear</p> <p>or the listener to ask her to clarify if she hasn't made herself clear.</p> <p>If you're watching anime, reading books or playing games or in general</p> <p>dealing with any kind of professional writing or speaking,</p> <p>people will make things clear unless they actually want to play games with ambiguity.</p> <p>So this is just the same as English or any other language.</p> <p>There's nothing special about Japanese in this context.</p> <p>If we go back to the example we used right back in our first lesson about the non-logical \u306f topic marker, <code>\u79c1\u306f\u3046\u306a\u304e\u3067\u3059</code>.</p> <p><code>\u79c1\u306f (zero\u304c) \u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3067\u3059</code> means <code>I am an American.</code> / As for me, (I) American-am </p> <p><code>\u79c1\u306f (zero\u304c) \u3046\u306a\u304e\u3067\u3059</code> does not usually mean <code>I am an eel.</code> As for me, (food?) eel-is</p> <p></p> <p>If it's spoken in a restaurant and the topic of conversation is what we're going to eat,</p> <p>then it'll be understood that the zero pronoun of that sentence is not <code>\u79c1</code> but the</p> <p>thing we're talking about: what we're going to have to eat.</p> <p>Could it ever mean <code>I am an eel</code>?</p> <p>Yes, it could.</p> <p>For example, if I go up to a stranger in the street and point to my nose (which is the</p> <p>way in Japan you indicate yourself) and say, <code>\u79c1\u306f\u3046\u306a\u304e\u3067\u3059</code>, they would know that</p> <p>I'm saying that I'm an eel and they'd probably think I was a little strange, because I don't look like an eel.</p> <p>I look a bit like a human but I hope not very much like an eel.</p> <p>Now, if in a restaurant we weren't talking about food at all, maybe about the weather,</p> <p>and I suddenly say <code>\u79c1\u306f\u3046\u306a\u304e\u3060</code>, people would probably still understand me</p> <p>to mean that I have decided I want to eat eel.</p> <p>So, how does this work?</p> <p>Well, in Japanese -- and it's just the same in English or any other language -- we have</p> <p>three rules that we apply to interpreting sentences that can be in any way ambiguous.</p> <p>And they are: context, probability, and the absurdity rule.</p> <p></p> <p>Context is the obvious one that we've already discussed.</p> <p>If I say <code>My left antenna was so broken that it fell off</code>, you know from context that <code>it</code> means my left antenna.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/48-dealing-with-ambiguity-in-japanese/#the-probability-rule","title":"The Probability Rule","text":"<p>Probability is the fact that when two possibilities are both possible and context hasn't actually told us which, we'll go for the one that's most probable.</p> <p>And this isn't just an accident.</p> <p>This is something everybody knows about language.</p> <p>So listeners do it, speakers expect listeners to do it, and language is tailored to work</p> <p>with those rules -- in Japanese or in English.</p> <p>So there's nothing mysterious about it.</p> <p>So, for example, if I say <code>I saw a man on a hill with a telescope</code>, probably you would</p> <p>interpret this as meaning I used the telescope in order to see the man on the hill.</p> <p>So that's probability, I haven't actually said anything to indicate that interpretation,</p> <p>but it's the most likely default interpretation.</p> <p>However, if you said to me, <code>Do you think we're being watched?</code> and I said, \"I think we are.</p> <p>I saw a man on a hill with a telescope\", then you would probably interpret me as saying</p> <p>that I saw, with my naked eye, a man on a hill who had a telescope and therefore was probably watching us.</p> <p>Now, there are other interpretations too.</p> <p>I could have meant I saw a man on a hill that had one of these public pay-telescopes on it, so <code>a hill with a telescope</code> would be where I saw the man.</p> <p>And one could even mean that I use a telescope as a saw to cut a man on a hill.</p> <p>Now, the last one, like <code>I am an eel</code>, is somewhat absurd and so that comes very low</p> <p>down the scale of anybody's making that interpretation.

For Receptive L13. * :::</p> <p>::: info There is also a mistake in the video\u2019s picture where it says that both attach to the \u3042-stem (Godan verbs), but Potential attaches to the \u3048-stem, whereas Receptive goes to the \u3042-stem. ::: And people often think, <code>Well, this is really worrying. The two are the same. How am I ever going to know which is which?</code></p> <p>And part of the problem here comes from the whole textbook approach to Japanese, which has to do with learning things in the abstract and dealing with these cut-off, isolated, out-of-context sentences.</p> <p>Although we need to learn structure, the way we learn Japanese is from immersion in Japanese, using real in-context Japanese language.</p> <p>So, let's look at this <code>-\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> problem.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>: <code>\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u305f</code>, if it's the potential, can mean either <code>I was able to eat</code> or <code>I was able to eat (something) / I was able to eat (this particular thing)</code>.</p> <p>On the other hand, if it's the receptive, it means <code>I received the action of eating</code>.</p> <p>In English we would say <code>I was eaten</code> or <code>I got eaten</code>, which is closer to the Japanese.</p> <p>It tends to get translated as a passive sentence -- <code>I was eaten</code> -- in English.</p> <p>What it actually means is literally <code>I got eaten / I received the act of being eaten</code>.</p> <p>And if we think of it as passive, we're going to get very messed-up with the structure of those sentences.</p> <p>But that's not really the subject of this video</p> <p>and you can watch my video on the Japanese receptive to clarify all this. Lesson 13</p> <p>The ambiguity here is that if I say <code>\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u305f</code> I could mean <code>I was able to eat</code> or I could mean <code>I got eaten</code>.</p> <p>Now, in this case the absurdity rule comes into play: I could be saying that I was eaten</p> <p>but considering that I'm standing here telling you that, it's not very probable.</p> <p>So I would have to say something more than that in order to get you to register the possibility</p> <p>that I could say that I had been eaten.</p> <p>So this is a simple case where the absurdity rule and the likelihood rule will determine what's being said and from probabilities of the particular case we're talking about.</p> <p>There can be cases where there's real ambiguity.</p> <p>For example in the case of a pet mouse.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u304c\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u305f</code>, we could mean that the mouse was able to eat something we gave her or able to eat in general or it could unfortunately mean that the mouse got eaten, perhaps by a cat.</p> <p></p> <p>How do we resolve this ambiguity?</p> <p>Well, we can't do it structurally.</p> <p>Just as in the telescope case in English, there are some cases where linguistic structural ambiguities are only resolvable by external considerations, the probabilities of the particular case.</p> <p>Now, people tend to act as if there were something special and strange about this happening in Japanese that would freeze us and make us unable to understand,</p> <p>but that's no more the case in Japanese than it is in English.</p> <p>Japanese is not some magical language ruled by strange, impenetrable rules.</p> <p>It's just a language, and it's a far more logical language than English,</p> <p>but like all languages there are many potential ambiguities,</p> <p>all of which are resolved by the speaker, the listener and the situation.</p> <p>Every now and again there is some genuine ambiguity where somebody can misunderstand,</p> <p>but no more than in English.</p> <p>Most of the time people communicate what they want to communicate without any difficulty,</p> <p>using both the structure of the language and external probabilities --</p> <p>and also a knowledge of how the language works.</p> <p>And to give an example of that, in our last lesson we examined the sentence</p> <p><code> (zero\u304c) \u3044\u3061\u3070\u3067\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u3092\u304b\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5c11\u5973\u306b\u3042\u3052\u305f</code></p> <p>-- <code>I gave the dress I bought at the market to a girl wearing glasses.</code></p> <p></p> <p>And then we elaborated a more complex sentence: <code>\u3042\u306e\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3092\u306a\u3050\u3063\u305f\u307f\u306b\u304f\u3044\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u306f (zero\u304c) \u79c1\u304c\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3067\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u3092\u304b\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5c11\u5973\u306b\u3042\u3052\u305f</code></p> <p>And this means: <code>That ugly foreigner who hit Sakura gave the dress I bought at the market to a girl wearing glasses.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, somebody asked me, \"How do we know that the first part of this, after 'the ugly foreigner',</p> <p>isn't working just like the original sentence?</p> <p>How do we know that that \u79c1\u304c isn't the subject of the sentence?</p> <p>Because after all a \u306f-statement is a non-logical statement.</p> <p>It doesn't have to be defining the subject of the sentence.</p> <p>It may be just standing on its own.</p> <p>So how do we know that this second part of the sentence doesn't just still mean</p> <p>'I gave the dress I bought at the market to a girl wearing glasses'?\"</p> <p>And the answer to that is a knowledge of how Japanese works.</p> <p>Although \u306f-statements are not logical, they are in fact grammatical.</p> <p>They're part of Japanese grammar.</p> <p>When we make a \u306f-statement it has to be related directly to the rest of what we're saying.</p> <p>Even in English, for example, if we were to say,</p> <p><code>Speaking of the Andromeda galaxy, Sakura's got a pimple on her nose</code>,</p> <p>you'd be taken aback, wouldn't you?</p> <p>What has Sakura's pimple got to do with the Andromeda galaxy?</p> <p>But in Japanese it's even more so, because the \u306f-statement isn't just saying <code>speaking of</code>.</p> <p>It's actually a grammatical connection.</p> <p>So if I were to say, \"Speaking of that ugly foreigner who hit Sakura, I gave the dress</p> <p>I bought at the market to a girl wearing glasses\", that makes no sense.</p> <p>Why are we saying <code>speaking of the ugly foreigner who hit Sakura</code>?</p> <p>Now, it's possible, just as it's possible for <code>\u79c1\u306f\u3046\u306a\u304e\u3060</code> to mean</p> <p><code>I am an eel</code> under certain circumstances, it's just possible, given surrounding circumstances, given something the listener knows that connects the two things together, that it could actually be working this way.</p> <p>If, for example, it was because of the ugly foreigner being there that we ended up giving</p> <p>the dress to the girl wearing spectacles.</p> <p>But, once again the burden of proof lies with the unlikely possibility.</p> <p>Unless we have good reason to think that there's some connection between the ugly foreigner who hit Sakura and the fact that I gave the dress to a girl wearing glasses,</p> <p>that's not the interpretation we're going to put on it.</p> <p>So again like the telescope sentence in English, we interpret sentences not only according to their strict structure but also according to the circumstances and the likelihoods of the situation.</p> <p>Because Japanese is a very logical language, I think sometimes people expect that everything should be determined by the structural logic of the language.</p> <p>But that isn't the case in Japanese.</p> <p>It isn't the case in English.</p> <p>It isn't the case in any language.</p> <p>So in order to interpret sentences with possible ambiguity, we can do this 99% of the time.</p> <p>We do it in English; we can do it in Japanese.</p> <p>Japanese people do it in Japanese; we can do it in Japanese.</p> <p>It's not a magical language with strange, inscrutable connections.</p> <p>It's a language just like English in this respect, that it works by structure but it also works by the everyday common sense criteria of language, which look at context, probability,</p> <p>and always rule out absurdity unless it's made very clear that absurdity is intended\u2026 ::: info You should have key grammar basics by now.

They're not \u3051\u3044\u3054/\u656c\u8a9e.</p> <p><code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> can imply gratitude but it doesn't imply humility.</p> <p>And <code>\u3042\u3052\u308b</code> doesn't imply honoring the person to whom it's applied.</p> <p>All right.

And I'll come to that in just a moment.</p> <p>Let's notice that if no giver is mentioned, then no giver is necessarily implied.</p> <p>When a giver is mentioned, the giver is marked by \u306b.</p> <p>Now, this is exactly the same as the receptive helper verb <code>-\u308c\u308b/-\u3089\u308c\u308b</code></p> <p>because <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>, like <code>-\u308c\u308b/-\u3089\u308c\u308b</code></p> <p>(the receptive, the so-called passive form, which is not passive at all),</p> <p>both of them are in fact about receiving, aren't they?</p> <p>So they're what we might call pull-sentences rather than push-sentences.</p> <p>In a push-sentence, the \u306b marks the indirect object, the ultimate receiver of the action.</p> <p>So, if we say <code>\u30e1\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u306b\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u6295\u3052\u305f</code>, we're saying <code>I threw the ball at Mary</code>.</p> <p>The ball is the direct object (what I threw).</p> <p>Mary is the indirect object (the ultimate receiver of the action).</p> <p></p> <p>In a pull-sentence, where the receiver is the \u304c-marked actor, then the \u306b-marked person</p> <p>is the ultimate giver, the ultimate source of the action.</p> <p>So it's actually much more useful to compare <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> to <code>-\u308c\u308b/-\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>, the receptive helper, because it does almost exactly the same thing.</p> <p>It takes a verb, adds another, helper verb to it which tells us that the action is being received and the actor of the sentence is doing the action of receiving the action from somebody else.</p> <p>And this similarity, this likeness, between <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> and <code>-\u308c\u308b/-</code>\u3089\u308c\u308b<code></code> is not pointed out</p> <p>by conventional Japanese grammar, although it's really by far the best way of understanding it,</p> <p>because of course they confuse the whole issue by calling the receptive <code>-\u308c\u308b/-\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> helper <code>passive</code>. It's not passive, it's receptive, just like <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>. ::: info Btw. you can\u2019t use both of these receptives at once. Dolly explains in the* comments. ::: </p> <p>And they work very similarly.</p> <p>The difference between them is that <code>-\u308c\u308b/-</code>\u3089\u308c\u308b<code></code> implies that the action just happened to us. We may or may not have wanted it, but it wasn't really our doing.</p> <p><code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> implies that we took the action, that we actively brought the action upon ourself</p> <p>from somebody else; we got them to do it for us.</p> <p>So let's talk about receiving a service.</p> <p>A very, very common expression is <code>(zero\u304c)\u304a\u533b\u8005\u3055\u3093\u306b\u898b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> which is translated in dictionaries and English grammars as <code>see a doctor</code>. And this is a terrible, terrible, terrible, irresponsible translation.</p> <p></p> <p>I don't know why they do this exactly.</p> <p>I think it's because they feel that the likeness to a common English expression makes it easier.</p> <p>It doesn't make it easier, it makes it much harder,</p> <p>because it confuses your entire perception of what's going on here.</p> <p><code>\u304a\u533b\u8005\u3055\u3093\u306b\u898b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> doesn't mean <code>I will see a doctor</code>;</p> <p>it means <code>I will have a doctor see me / I will get examined by a doctor</code>.</p> <p>Now, we can see this much more clearly if we're talking about hairdressing or a haircut.</p> <p><code>\u3055\u3093\u3071\u3064/\u6563\u9aea</code> means <code>hairdressing</code> or <code>haircut</code>.</p> <p>And if we say <code>\u6563\u9aea\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>, we're saying <code>have someone cut my hair</code>.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u304a\u533b\u8005\u3055\u3093\u306b\u898b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> -- <code>have a doctor look at me / examine me</code>.</p> <p>So you see the two work in exactly the same way.</p> <p>And we can also see that while with <code>\u304a\u533b\u8005\u3055\u3093</code> we're specifying a giver,</p> <p>with <code>\u6563\u9aea\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> -- <code>get one's hair cut</code> -- we're not specifying a particular actor.</p> <p>Someone might say <code>\u6563\u9aea\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305f\u307b\u3046\u304c\u3044\u3044</code> -- <code>you should get your hair cut</code> --</p> <p>but it's not saying anything about by whom.</p> <p>It's not saying whether they want you to go to the hairdresser or</p> <p>whether you get your big sister to do it, it doesn't matter.</p> <p>Just <code>get someone to cut your hair</code>.</p> <p>And this leads to another very important point, which is that the actor of <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>,</p> <p>the person <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>-ing, does not have to be the speaker.</p> <p>And by comparing it to <code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> a lot of people get very confused by this</p> <p>and they get extremely muddled when they see someone</p> <p>referring to someone else other than themselves <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>-ing.</p> <p>But there's no rule against this at all.</p> <p>You can't use <code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> for someone who isn't either yourself or a member of your in-group or, for example in a novel, it could be a character</p> <p>because the writer is allowed to be inside the head of the character.</p> <p>So <code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> is tied to a person or an in-group, but <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> is not.</p> <p>We can freely talk about other people <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>-ing, receiving something.</p> <p>Now, another important area that confuses people terribly,</p> <p>but we're ready to deal with this now, is <code>\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>,</p> <p>which is a combination of the causative helper verb with <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>,</p> <p>and we now know enough about the logic of <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> to deal with this,</p> <p>but we're going to need to learn a little bit more</p> <p>about the logic of the causative helper verb <code>-\u305b\u308b/-\u3055\u305b\u308b</code>...</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/5-verb-groups-and-the-%E3%81%A6-form/","title":"5.

You never do anything except take off the -\u308b and put on whatever you're going to put on, in this case a \u3066 or a \u305f.</p> <p>As for the godan verbs, they fall into five groups, as you would expect (\u4e94\u6bb5/\u3054\u3060\u3093, five-level verbs), and I made a video about this a while ago. So what I'm going to do is run that video right now, because it explains things pretty clearly.</p> <p>All right, roll the video.</p> <p>Godan verbs have five kinds of possible ending \u2013 that's why they're called godan verbs: five-level verbs.</p> <p></p> <p>And although that seems a little bit difficult, it really isn't. We can combine two of the levels anyway, because they are so close that we only need to learn them once. And I'm going to go through the main groups.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/5-verb-groups-and-the-%E3%81%A6-form/#the-first-godan-group","title":"The First Godan Group","text":"<p>The first group is what I call the UTSURU/\u3046\u3064\u308b verbs. Those are the verbs ending in -\u3046, -\u3064 and -\u308b. The word \u3046\u3064\u308b in Japanese \u2013 if you don't know it, now is a good time to learn it \u2013 \u3046\u3064\u308b means to move from one thing to another, and that's exactly what we're doing here \u2013 moving our verbs from one type to another.</p> <p>So the verbs which end in -\u3046, -\u3064 and -\u308b all transform in the same way to the \u3066-form. We take off the -\u3046, the -\u3064 or the -\u308b, and we replace it with a small -\u3063plus \u3066 (or \u305f in the \u305f-form).</p> <p>So \u308f\u3089\u3046 - laugh, becomes \u308f\u3089\u3063\u3066 (Waratte); \u3082\u3064 - hold, becomes \u3082\u3063\u3066 (Motte); and \u3068\u308b - take, becomes \u3068\u3063\u3066 (Totte).</p> <p>Now, you'll notice that \u3046\u3064\u308b has \u3064 in the middle.</p> <p></p> <p>And the \u3066-form of the \u3046\u3064\u308b verbs is formed by using a small \u3063 plus that \u3066. It's the only group that has \u3064 in it, and it's the only group that has a \u3064 in the \u3066-form ending. </p> <p>So it's really easy to remember.</p> <p>::: tip You can type the small \u3063 by typing t before a T-kana \u3063\u305f (tta), or by X key + tsu. This also applies to <code>\u3042, \u3044, \u3046, \u3048, \u304a</code> kana - \u3041 (X + a), \u3043 (X + i)... Note also \u3065 (typed - Du) and \u3062 (Di) - irregular \u305a and \u3058 kana forms. In case you ever need to type them, can happen.

Buumu, a New Buumu!</p> <p>So, this group I call the New Boom group because there isn't a Japanese word that you can make out of \u306c, \u3076 and \u3080 that I know of, and what I want you to notice about this group of verbs is that they all end in what I would call a dull sound \u2013 \u306c, \u3076, \u3080.</p> <p></p> <p>It's not a sharp sound like \u3059, \u3064, \u304f, and it's not a neutral sound like \u308b or \u3046.

Now, I've done a whole lesson on this (Lesson 19)</p> <p>and we've talked about most of the aspects of it which cause trouble to foreigners.</p> <p>However, there's one part that I didn't go into because it wasn't really relevant at that time,</p> <p>so we're going to look at that now.</p> <p>As I said at the time, the causative helper verb is, for a change, very well named in</p> <p>English-language Japanese grammar because that's exactly what it is -- it's the causative form.</p> <p>So when we attach it to another verb what we're saying is <code>cause someone to do that verb</code>.</p> <p>Now, one thing that confuses English speakers is that it can mean</p> <p>either <code>allow someone to do it</code> or <code>make or compel someone to do it</code>,</p> <p>and the causative verb in itself doesn't draw the distinction between those two.</p> <p>That confuses English speakers because English does draw the distinction.</p> <p>We say <code>make someone do something</code> or <code>let someone do something</code>;</p> <p>we don't say <code>cause someone to do something</code>.</p> <p>The thing we now have to understand is that the Japanese causative can mean <code>make</code>,</p> <p>it can mean <code>allow</code>, but it doesn't have to mean either.</p> <p>It means exactly what it says on the packet.</p> <p>It means <code>cause -- by any means</code>, doesn't specify what means we're using to cause someone to do something.</p> <p>And this confuses English speakers because they don't have a way of saying this.</p> <p>You can't really say <code>cause someone to do something</code>, at least not in modern English.</p> <p>And actually English sometimes feels the loss of this and has to make up for it by cheating with what it has.</p> <p>So, an example of that is when we say <code>Would you let me know tomorrow?</code> or <code>I'll let you know tomorrow</code>.</p> <p>We don't actually mean <code>let you know</code> or <code>let me know</code>.</p> <p>We mean <code>cause me to know</code>.</p> <p>We don't mean <code>allow me to know</code>; we don't mean <code>force me to know</code>.</p> <p>We mean <code>cause me to know</code>.</p> <p>But because we don't have this <code>cause someone to do something</code> expression in modern English, we actually have to cheat and say <code>let me know</code>, which isn't what we really mean.</p> <p>In Japanese, of course, we use the causative for this.</p> <p>So, <code>\u77e5\u308b</code> is <code>know</code> and <code>\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u308b</code> is <code>cause someone to know</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So this is essentially doing what English <code>let me know</code> is doing,</p> <p>without having to bend the grammar to do it the way English does.</p> <p>And this causative can be used in many other ways that don't mean either <code>make</code> or <code>allow</code>.</p> <p>So <code>\u805e\u304f</code>, for example, is <code>hear</code>; so <code>\u805e\u304b\u305b\u308b</code> means <code>cause to hear</code>.</p> <p>And we might say <code>\u5f8c\u3067\u805e\u304b\u305b\u3088\u3046</code>, which means \"I'll tell you tomorrow (later on) /</p> <p>tomorrow I'll cause you to hear / tomorrow I'll give you all the information\".</p> <p></p> <p>And we can lego this together with other words, so we can have something like <code>\u8aad\u307f\u805e\u304b\u305b\u308b</code>,</p> <p>which means <code>read and cause to hear</code>/read-cause-to-hear.</p> <p></p> <p>And this is what we say if we're reading someone a story, reading a letter to someone,</p> <p>or something like that: <code>\u8aad\u307f\u805e\u304b\u305b\u308b</code></p> <p>And once we understand this way in which the causative helper works,</p> <p>we can see how it gets \u3066-formed to have <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> attached to it.</p> <p>For example, we might say <code>\u805e\u304b\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3048\u307e\u3059\u304b</code>, which means <code>Can you tell me?</code></p> <p><code>\u805e\u304b\u305b\u3066</code> -- <code>cause me to hear</code>; <code>\u3082\u3089\u3048\u308b</code>, which is the potential form of <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>, in other words <code>possible to receive</code>.</p> <p></p> <p><code>Is it possible to receive you causing me to hear?</code> which in English, we'd probably say <code>Can you tell me?</code></p> <p>So, this <code>\u805e\u304b\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3048\u307e\u3059\u304b</code> might seem very confusing to a foreign speaker because it isn't</p> <p>how we put it in English, but, as you can see, structurally it's very straightforward.</p> <p>It's built out of elements that we already know and understand and it makes perfect sense.</p> <p>We could take the sentence <code>\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3082\u4e0b\u5bbf\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3048\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b</code>.</p> <p>And this would tend to get translated as meaning <code>Do you take in students?</code></p> <p>But literally what it's saying is <code>Even if one is a student ...</code> -- <code>\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3082</code> --</p> <p><code>...is it not possible to receive being caused to lodge here?</code></p> <p></p> <p>That's the structure of this, so when you see this <code>\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3082\u4e0b\u5bbf\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3048\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b</code></p> <p>and you get told that it means <code>Do you take in students?</code>, you can look at it backwards,</p> <p>forwards and upside down and wonder how those words come to mean that.</p> <p>And of course they don't really come to mean that at all. That's just what we would say in English. In Japanese we're saying <code>Even if one is a student, is it not possible to receive being caused to lodge here?</code></p> <p>And it doesn't necessarily have to be oneself that's being caused to do something in these sentences.</p> <p>For example, if we say <code> (zero\u304c) \u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u3092\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305f</code>, this gets translated as <code>I was fitted for glasses</code>,</p> <p>but what it literally means is <code>to receive the glasses being caused to fit</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So it's the glasses that are being caused.</p> <p>They're the ones that are being <code>\u3055\u305b\u308b</code>-ed, but I am the one receiving their being caused to fit.</p> <p>So it doesn't have to be me personally receiving being caused.</p> <p>I could be receiving something else being caused as well.</p> <p>So, we have to look at the sentence and see what it means and, of course,</p> <p>apply the rules we talked about in the lesson about busting ambiguity (Lesson 48) --</p> <p>we look at what's most probable, knowing that if something improbable is being said</p> <p>the speaker will have to make that clear, just as they do in English.</p> <p>Now, sometimes of course it can actually mean <code>allow</code>, so for example if we say <code>\u5e30\u3089\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u307e\u3059</code>,</p> <p>what we're really literally saying is <code>I will receive your allowing me to go home</code>.</p> <p>That's the literal meaning.</p> <p></p> <p>It's rather like saying in English <code>With your permission, I'll leave now</code>, which could very well mean <code>I'll leave now, with or without your permission</code>, but it puts a veneer of politeness over the matter.</p> <p>And whether it's genuinely polite or whether it's just informing someone that you're going with a thin veneer of politeness, this is something you'll obviously grasp from context and tone of voice etc., just as you would in English.</p> <p>There's a considerable difference between saying \"With your permission I'll go home now**** [softly]</p> <p>and saying \"With your permission I'll go home now**** [harshly] --</p> <p>and that's just the same in Japanese as in English.</p> <p>So, as you see, there are many ways in which these elements can be combined,</p> <p>but if we understand each of them and we understand how they fit together,</p> <p>we have the tools necessary to assimilate from immersion how these things are used.</p> <p>Remember, structure doesn't teach us how to understand Japanese.</p> <p>It gives us the basic tools we need in order to pick it up from the only place you can</p> <p>really learn how a language works -- and that is direct immersion.</p> <p>And I'll just add before we go... I'm not teaching \u656c\u8a9e/\u3051\u3044\u3054 at this point.</p> <p>\u656c\u8a9e is hyper-polite Japanese, which is almost a little sub-language of its own.</p> <p>It's not that difficult, but it will take a few lessons to go into it.</p> <p>But I want to mention here that there is a \u656c\u8a9e word for <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>. And that is <code>\u9802\u304f/\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f</code>.</p> <p>Because it's hyper-polite, it's usually used in \u307e\u3059-form, so it's usually <code>\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059</code>.</p> <p>And undoubtedly you'll be familiar with that as being the thing people say before they eat: <code>\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059!</code></p> <p>But what it literally means is something like <code>I humbly receive</code>.</p> <p>It obviously means <code>I receive</code>, because <code>\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f</code> means <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>,</p> <p>but it is a form of \u656c\u8a9e called <code>\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e/\u3051\u3093\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054</code>or <code>humble language</code>, so you're saying <code>I humbly receive</code>.</p> <p>And I'm mentioning this at this point because you will probably see</p> <p>some of these <code>\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>-type forms used with <code>\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f</code>: <code>\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059</code> etc.</p> <p>And this piece of \u656c\u8a9e can get used a little more often than regular \u656c\u8a9e</p> <p>because it adds politeness to the concept of <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So sometimes if there seems to be a danger of being a bit demanding or grabby by saying what you're going to receive or what you want to receive,</p> <p>you might use <code>\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f</code> to take the edge off that and show that you're actually being humble and polite.</p> <p>So if you see <code>\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f / \u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059</code> used in any of these places,</p> <p>it means exactly the same thing as <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>. It's just putting a more polite edge on it.</p> <p>So you needn't be confused by that when you see it.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/51-how-to-read-a-japanese-%E6%80%AA%E8%AB%87-%E3%81%8B%E3%81%84%E3%81%A0%E3%82%93-ghost-story/","title":"51.

So, the first word here is <code>\u305d\u308c\u306f</code>, and it's rather like saying in English <code>It was</code>.</p> <p>And we often begin a story, especially a ghost story, with this kind of expression, don't we?</p> <p><code>It was a dark and stormy night...</code></p> <p>So, you might start by asking, \"Why is this \u305d\u308c\u306f,</p> <p>which means 'that is' or 'that was' rather than 'it was'?\"</p> <p>Well, it's a very simple reason.</p> <p>There is no visible word for <code>it</code> in Japanese.</p> <p>The function of what is <code>it</code> in English is always in Japanese performed by the zero pronoun.</p> <p>And it's very important to understand this because it's one of the fundamental keys to understanding Japanese.</p> <p>We do have pronouns in Japanese for <code>me</code> and <code>you</code> and <code>they</code> and <code>she</code> and <code>he</code>,</p> <p>and the zero pronoun is used in the places these would be used in English more often than not, but there is no word at all in Japanese for the simple neutral pronoun <code>it</code>.</p> <p>So, in the cases like this where we actually want to make a topic of what would be <code>it</code> in English, we use the slightly more definite pronoun <code>that</code>.</p> <p>So we say <code>that was</code>. Here we're saying <code>it was</code>.</p> <p>Now, we don't know at this stage that it's <code>it was</code>, and in fact we never learn that directly.</p> <p>Now, if you want to make sense of this sentence, we can run through it piece by piece</p> <p>and if we're listening to it without having the words in front of us, we have to do that.</p> <p>And it's not that difficult to do. But I'm going to use a shortcut here because when you have the text in front of you you can do that.</p> <p>I don't think we should work backward the way Rubin-\u5148\u751f suggests,</p> <p>even though I'm a great fan of Rubin-\u5148\u751f in some ways.</p> <p>But what we can do is take a glimpse at the end because it's going to tell us where</p> <p>this whole rather complicated-looking sentence is actually going.</p> <p>So, the end of the sentence -- and we know that the engine of a sentence always comes at the end and then it may be followed by a couple of sentence-ender particles,</p> <p>but the engine comes at the end apart from that.</p> <p>And what comes at the end of this sentence is <code>\u65e5</code> -- <code>day</code>.</p> <p>Now, when we see a noun ending a sentence like this, we know that this is going to be an <code>A is B</code> sentence and that the copula <code>\u3060</code> or <code>\u3067\u3059</code>, which belongs there to turn it into a sentence, has been dropped.</p> <p>Now, this happens relatively often in casual speech.</p> <p>And this is casual speech -- <code>casual speech</code> is a bit of a catch-all term, but</p> <p>this is the kind of language we'll be using perhaps in a sleepover or something</p> <p>where we're telling <code>\u602a\u8ac7</code>, where we're telling creepy tales to each other.</p> <p>And so we're using that level of language where sometimes the copula will get dropped.</p> <p>And we'll see a few other things being dropped in the course of this story.</p> <p>So, we have the structure of the sentence here.</p> <p><code>\u305d\u308c\u306f</code> sets the topic, and that's also going to be the subject, so it's <code>\u305d\u308c\u306fzero\u304c</code>.</p> <p>And then <code>\u65e5</code>, that's all. <code>It was... day.</code></p> <p></p> <p>And we don't even know that it <code>was</code>, because we need the copula on the end to give us the tense.</p> <p>So if the copula was <code>\u3060</code>, it would end <code>\u3060\u3063\u305f</code>; if it were <code>\u3067\u3059</code>, it would end <code>\u3067\u3057\u305f</code>.</p> <p>As it is, we have no tense marker.</p> <p>But because we know this is setting the scene for a story, we can tell from that fact that</p> <p>this is an <code>It was</code>-type statement, a scene-setting statement.</p> <p>So what about the rest of this sentence?</p> <p><code>\u3042\u308b\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u304c\u5148\u8f29\u306e\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u98f2\u307f\u4f1a\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u305f</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, as you see, between the <code>\u305d\u308c\u306f</code> and the <code>\u65e5</code> comes a complete logical sentence in itself.</p> <p>And we can see that each clause in this logical sentence, just as we've seen in our videos</p> <p>on word order (Lesson 46) and sentence structure, works by successively modifying each element.</p> <p>So, <code>\u3042\u308b\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u304c\u5148\u8f29\u306e\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u98f2\u307f\u4f1a\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u305f</code></p> <p>*** It's modification mania! ***</p> <p></p> <p>So this sentence, again, we can break down into its A-car, which is obviously <code>\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u304c</code>,</p> <p>and its engine, which is <code>\u3057\u305f</code> -- <code>did</code>.</p> <p>And then <code>\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u305f</code> -- <code>'\u53c2\u52a0 did**** -- </code>took part\".</p> <p>And then all the rest of this sentence is successively modifying elements which modify <code>\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u305f</code>: <code>\u5148\u8f29\u306e\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u98f2\u307f\u4f1a</code>.</p> <p>So, <code>\u98f2\u307f\u4f1a</code> is <code>a drinking party / a drinking meeting</code>.</p> <p><code>\u98f2\u307f</code> is the \u3044-stem, the noun form of <code>\u98f2\u3080</code> - to drink -</p> <p>which is put together with <code>\u4f1a</code> - a meeting or party - to give us <code>drinking party</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And then everything before that modifies <code>drinking party</code>.</p> <p><code>\u5148\u8f29\u306e\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u98f2\u307f\u4f1a</code> -- <code>a drinking party held in senpai's apartment</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So we have <code>\u3042\u308b\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u304c</code> -- <code>a certain girl</code> --</p> <p><code>\u5148\u8f29\u306e\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u98f2\u307f\u4f1a\u306b</code> \u2013 and this gives us the place where she went to take part. It was a drinking party held in senpai's apartment.</p> <p>So we have that whole logical clause:</p> <p><code>a certain girl -- took part in -- a drinking party -- held at -- senpai's apartment</code></p> <p>and all of that is a modifier for <code>day</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So, <code>\u305d\u308c\u306f...</code> -- <code>It was a day when a certain girl attended a drinking party held in senpai's apartment.</code></p> <p>So you see this isn't constructed the way we generally expect English to be constructed,</p> <p>but that's fine because we have some experience now about how Japanese is constructed.</p> <p>And I think you'll agree this all makes good sense.</p> <p>So that is setting the scene. It's telling us the day when this happened and it's filling in details about that day which are going to be relevant as we move into the story.</p> <p>Well, that took rather longer than I expected for a single sentence,</p> <p>but I think it's worth going into it in detail, don't you?</p> <p>So I'm afraid we'll have to leave this on a bit of a shorter cliffhanger than I had originally anticipated, but the next few sentences I think will contain less questions,</p> <p>so we should be able to proceed through the text a little bit more quickly next time.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/52-in-depth-japanese-sentence-analysis-in-real-native-context/","title":"52.

Well, stick it to your surroundings, stick it to what you're doing.</p> <p>In other words, pay attention. Now, the translation <code>take care</code> is actually better culturally than <code>pay attention</code>, because <code>pay attention</code> sounds like an order, doesn't it?</p> <p>And that's not the atmosphere of saying <code>\u6c17\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u3066</code>.</p> <p>::: info Dolly-\u5148\u751f says <code>\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u304f\u3066</code>, but I think she meant to say \u6c17\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u3066 instead as the first one does not really seem to make sense, and I failed to find anything about it, especially pointing to said <code>take care</code> or the like...my theory is that she misspoke, but nobody noticed. ::: In practice, culturally it means something more like <code>take care</code>,</p> <p>so the translation isn't wrong but the structure isn't the same.</p> <p>So now we get an idea why we say <code>\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6c17\u3065\u304f</code> rather than <code>\u3053\u3068\u3092\u6c17\u3065\u304f</code>.</p> <p>If we stick a poster to a wall, the wall, the thing it's stuck to, is not the direct object, is it?</p> <p>The direct object is the poster; the wall is the ultimate target of that action.</p> <p>And ultimate targets, in Japanese, are always marked by \u306b.</p> <p>As we know, the indirect object, the ultimate target, is marked by \u306b.</p> <p>Now, even if we take the human actor out of this and just say <code>The poster sticks to the wall</code>, we're still saying <code>to the wall</code>, aren't we?</p> <p>We're not saying <code>The poster sticks the wall</code>, which is what we would say if the wall were the direct object.</p> <p>We're saying <code>The poster sticks to the wall</code>. The wall is the target of the poster's sticking.</p> <p>So by the same token, if we stick our spirit to something or if our spirit sticks to something, the something to which it sticks is the target, not the direct object of that sticking.</p> <p>Now, this is important to know, because it's another small example of the way that</p> <p><code>\u3048\u3044\u307b\u3093\u3054</code> -- so-called English-language Japanese grammar,</p> <p>the stuff you find in the textbooks and the websites everywhere \u2013</p> <p></p> <p>it's another way in which it simply messes up our understanding</p> <p>of the logic and structure of a very, very logical language.</p> <p>Because what they'll tell you is <code>\u6c17\u3065\u304f</code> is a verb that means realize, but it takes \u306b\".</p> <p>Now, leaving aside the fact that no verb can take \u306b or any other logical particle</p> <p>(only a noun can ever take a logical particle), we know what they mean.</p> <p>They mean that this word, that means <code>realize</code>,</p> <p>which in English treats the thing realized as the direct object,</p> <p>actually treats the thing realized as a target and therefore marks it with \u306b</p> <p>and \"this is one of those weird quirks of Japanese that you have to learn in every individual case</p> <p>because it's so random and irrational\". It's not random and irrational at all.</p> <p></p> <p>While <code>\u6c17\u3065\u304f</code> is broadly equivalent to <code>realize</code> in English, it's not the same structure.</p> <p>We're not real-izing, making something real, we are sticking our spirit to something</p> <p>and that something is a target and therefore it's marked by \u306b,</p> <p>just as targets are always marked by \u306b. ::: info obviously that something \u306b-marked is a noun, like \u3053\u3068. Not the verb \u6c17\u3065\u304f that <code>takes \u306b</code>, like some textbooks say. Just in case mentioning this again, as it can be a tad bit confusing. ::: Japanese doesn't go in for random irrationalities.</p> <p>You need to go to European languages if you want that.</p> <p>And if I can just pop in a little footnote here.</p> <p>This talk of verbs taking particles is hugely, hugely misleading.</p> <p></p> <p>It's not just a quibble to say that logical particles can only ever belong to nouns, never to verbs.</p> <p>I said I knew what they were talking about when they spoke of verbs taking particles,</p> <p>but what they're talking about is horribly wrong on every occasion.</p> <p>It's based on the fallacy that logical particles can perform different functions in relation to different verbs.</p> <p>And they never, ever can.</p> <p>The only reason for ever thinking so is, as in this case, misunderstanding what the verb is actually doing, usually because they assume that it works exactly like its nearest English equivalent, which is very often not the case.</p> <p>And as we've seen in the case of the potential helper verb and adjectives of subjectivity,</p> <p>this fallacy covers a huge area of Japanese and makes a very large contribution</p> <p>to the inability of many students to understand Japanese.</p> <p>Because it seems so illogical and random when in fact it's completely logical.</p> <p>That's why we call them <code>logical particles</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>They never change their function regardless of what adjective or verb is involved in the sentence.</p> <p>They always, always do the same thing.</p> <p>And if you're at all confused about what I'm saying here, please see the ninth lesson in this course. And I'll put a card up for that right now.</p> <p><code>\u5f7c\u5973\u306f\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u5f15\u304d\u8fd4\u3057\u5148\u8f29\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u306b\u623b\u3063\u3066\u547c\u3073\u9234\u3092\u62bc\u3059</code></p> <p></p> <p>So she returned to senpai's apartment. <code>\u5f15\u304d\u8fd4\u3057</code>, that means <code>return</code>,</p> <p>and as we've seen before, the \u3044-stem of a verb -- the verb is <code>\u5f15\u304d\u8fd4\u3059</code>, which is <code>return</code> --</p> <p>and particularly in narrative we can use the \u3044-stem of a verb in much the same way</p> <p>as we use the \u3066-form of a verb to make it the first clause of a compound sentence.</p> <p>So, she returned to senpai's apartment --</p> <p><code>\u5148\u8f29\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u306b\u623b\u3063\u3066\u547c\u3073\u9234\u3092\u62bc\u3059</code>. She returned to senpai's room and pushed the bell.</p> <p><code>\u547c\u3073\u9234</code>: <code>\u547c\u3076</code> is <code>call</code>, <code>\u9234/\u308a\u3093</code> is the on-reading of <code>\u9234/\u3059\u305a</code>, <code>a small bell</code>,</p> <p>so <code>\u547c\u3073\u9234</code> is a <code>call-bell / a bell for calling</code>.</p> <p><code>\u62bc\u3059</code>: she presses the bell. And as we've seen before,</p> <p>in Japanese narrative it is allowable to use present-tense sentences</p> <p>within a past-tense narrative to add immediacy.</p> <p>And the sense here is that we've come to a point here, to a point almost like a landing on the stairs where we rest for a moment and make this our present.</p> <p>She pressed the bell.</p> <p><code>\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c\u53cd\u5fdc\u304c\u306a\u3044</code></p> <p></p> <p><code>\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c</code> is an expression that we'll often find in narrative, again.</p> <p><code>\u304c</code>: This <code>\u304c</code> is obviously not the particle \u304c.</p> <p>It's the other <code>\u304c</code>, which is a contrastive conjunction and essentially means <code>but</code>.</p> <p>Why do we add <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d</code> to it?</p> <p>Well, as we discussed in a previous lesson, <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d</code>,</p> <p>which means <code>place</code>, can also mean a place in time.</p> <p>It's almost like a resting place in time. It gives us a temporary <code>now</code>, as it were.</p> <p>So when we say <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c</code>, we're saying <code>at that point / at that time, but</code>.</p> <p>So we're using this as a narrative conjunction to mark the fact that</p> <p>something is happening that's contrary to our expectations or wishes.</p> <p>So, <code>\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c\u53cd\u5fdc\u304c\u306a\u3044</code>. So although she pressed the bell,</p> <p>there was, unexpectedly or contrary to our hopes, our wishes, there was no answer.</p> <p>And when she turned the doorknob... <code>\u56de\u3059</code></p> <p>As we know, <code>\u56de\u308b</code> is to <code>go around</code>,</p> <p><code>\u56de\u3059</code> is the other-move version of <code>\u56de\u308b</code>, so it's to <code>cause to go around</code>.</p> <p>When she caused the doorknob to turn, when she turned the doorknob,</p> <p><code>\u9375\u306f\u639b\u304b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> The lock existed in a state of not being locked, of not being hooked or hung or fixed.</p> <p>A slightly confusing-seeming expression because it comes from the fact that</p> <p>Japanese people often lump together the concept of a key and the concept of a lock into one. Strictly speaking, this could be called incorrect.</p> <p></p> <p>Really we're saying <code>\u9320\u524d\u304c\u639b\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> -- the lock was fixed or hooked,</p> <p>but it's common in Japanese to say the key was fixed or hooked (<code>\u9375\u304c\u639b\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>)</p> <p>and it would seem even a little unnatural to say it correctly.</p> <p>And because the door was unlocked, <code>\u5f7c\u5973\u306f\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u4e2d\u306b\u5165\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f</code> -- she went in.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e</code> we discussed in another video (Lesson 42) and, as we know, a <code>\u307e\u307e</code> is an unchanged condition.</p> <p><code>\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e</code> means <code>in that unchanged condition / just as it is</code>.</p> <p>And we can see here how that concept is being extended a little in a way that we'll find often.</p> <p>So, for example, if we're talking about edamame, and we say <code>\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u98df\u3079\u308b</code>,</p> <p>we mean \"eat them just as it is, eat them without changing their condition,</p> <p>eat them without doing anything further to prepare for eating them<code> and this is what </code>\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\" means here.</p> <p>Because the door was unlocked, she went in just like that, just in her present condition.</p> <p>She didn't press the bell again, she didn't wait to be invited, but <code>\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e</code></p> <p>-- in the unchanged condition of that moment -- she went in\u2026</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/53-enjoy-japanese-horror-in-japanese/","title":"53. Enjoy Japanese Horror in Japanese","text":"<p>Enjoy Japanese Horror in Japanese | Lesson 53</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to encounter a lot of the structural points in Japanese</p> <p>that we've covered in this course of lessons in action, in real situations.</p> <p>And we're going to do that by continuing with the <code>\u602a\u8ac7</code>, the Japanese story,</p> <p>that we've been reading over the last few lessons</p> <p>by courtesy of our Japanese partner channel, Akasic Tails.</p> <p>And we're going to be covering such a lot of points this time that I'll put up cards</p> <p>for some of the main ones but I've also made a supporting page on Kawajapa where you can</p> <p>go and look up any of these points and follow them up if you need to do so.</p> <p>And I think it would be a very good idea to follow up anything that</p> <p>you're not absolutely clear about after we go through this story.</p> <p>Now, to remind you where we got to at the end of last week's lesson,</p> <p>our heroine had gone to a drinking party at her senpai's apartment.</p> <p>After she left the party and was walking home at night, she became aware that</p> <p>she'd left her <code>\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71</code>, her portable telephone, in senpai's apartment.</p> <p>So she went back, pressed the bell, but there was no answer,</p> <p>turned the handle of the door and found that it wasn't locked.</p> <p>So she walked right in.</p> <p>So, let's see what happened next.</p> <p><code>\u90e8\u5c4b\u306e\u4e2d\u306f\u96fb\u6c17\u304c\u3064\u3044\u3066\u304a\u3089\u305a</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, so long as we understand that <code>\u96fb\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u308b</code> means <code>turn on the lights</code></p> <p>(literally it means <code>turn on the electricity</code>, but it in fact refers to the lights),</p> <p>the only problem with this clause is <code>\u304a\u3089\u305a</code>.</p> <p>What does that mean?</p> <p>Well, <code>\u304a\u308b</code> means the same as <code>\u3044\u308b</code>, which is to <code>be</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Generally we're told that it means to <code>be</code> of animate beings, like animals and people.</p> <p>It's not quite as simple as that and I've explained that in another lesson, which I'll link. <code>\u304a\u308b</code> is a rather older form of <code>\u3044\u308b</code>, but we encounter it in a variety of circumstances.</p> <p>For example, it is used in keigo as a humble form, <code>\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e/\u3051\u3093\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054</code> form, of <code>\u3044\u308b</code></p> <p>which we use to humble our own actions and possessions,</p> <p>but it's also used in dialect, in Kansai-ben for example,</p> <p>and it's used in literary contexts to give a literary narrative feel.</p> <p>And that's how it's being used here.</p> <p>So, <code>\u304a\u308b</code> means <code>\u3044\u308b</code>, but what does <code>\u304a\u3089\u305a</code> mean?</p> <p>Well, you also have to understand that <code>-\u305a</code> is also a piece of older Japanese which gives</p> <p>a literary feeling to a narrative and it's simply a negative helper like <code>-\u306a\u3044</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So why is it <code>\u304a\u3089\u305a</code>?</p> <p>Well, that's because while <code>\u3044\u308b</code>, as we know, is an ichidan verb,</p> <p><code>\u304a\u308b</code>, as it happens, is a godan verb.</p> <p>So, as with all godan verbs, the negative helper is attached to the \u3042-stem.</p> <p>So that's what's happening here.</p> <p><code>\u304a\u3089\u305a</code> means the same as <code>\u3044\u306a\u3044</code>.</p> <p>So, <code>\u96fb\u6c17\u304c\u3064\u3044\u3066\u304a\u3089\u305a</code> means <code>the electricity existed in a state of not having been switched on</code> or, in plain English, the lights were off.</p> <p><code>\u771f\u3063\u6697\u3067</code>: <code>\u771f\u3063\u6697</code> is <code>pitch-dark</code>, literally <code>true dark / complete dark</code>.</p> <p><code>\u6697</code>, of course, we know as <code>\u6697\u3044</code>, the adjective <code>dark</code>,</p> <p>and we know that when we see an adjective without its -\u3044 on the end,</p> <p>if it makes a word at all, it will be a noun.</p> <p></p> <p>We also know that if we see a word that is all kanji, it's almost certainly going to be a noun.</p> <p>So <code>\u771f\u3063\u6697</code> is <code>pitch darkness</code>.</p> <p><code>\u771f\u3063\u6697\u3067</code> -- the <code>\u3067</code> here is the \u3066-form of <code>\u3060</code> or <code>\u3067\u3059</code>.</p> <p>So, <code>\u90e8\u5c4b\u306e\u4e2d\u306f\u96fb\u6c17\u304c\u3064\u3044\u3066\u304a\u3089\u305a\u771f\u3063\u6697\u3067</code> --</p> <p><code>As for the inside of the room, the lights were off, it was pitch dark</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3084\u3089\u5148\u8f29\u306f\u3082\u3046\u5bdd\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3089\u3057\u3044</code></p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3084\u3089</code>: in this case means <code>it seems, it appears to be the case</code></p> <p>and this is actually working in tandem with the <code>-\u3089\u3057\u3044</code> at the end,</p> <p>which also means <code>seems like, appears to be</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And we've covered this in a previous lesson as well. (Lesson 25)</p> <p>So in between this sandwich that gives us the <code>it appears to be the case</code> meaning,</p> <p>it says <code>\u5148\u8f29\u306f\u3082\u3046\u5bdd\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f</code> --</p> <p><code>senpai has already done gone to sleep / done gone to bed</code>.</p> <p>As we know, that <code>\u3057\u307e\u3046, \u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f</code> gives that <code>done</code> meaning.</p> <p>And that's really the best way to put it in English.</p> <p>It sounds a bit rustic in English, but there's nothing else in English which I think gives</p> <p>that sense of <code>\u3057\u307e\u3046, \u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f, \u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f</code> quite as well as <code>done</code>.</p> <p>She'd already done gone to bed, it seemed.</p> <p><code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3\u3060\u306a</code>: <code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3</code> means literally <code>not using one's heart</code>,</p> <p>but <code>heart</code> here means mind or spirit.</p> <p><code>\u7528\u5fc3</code> is <code>care</code> or <code>cautiousness</code>; <code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3</code> is <code>lack of care</code> or <code>lack of cautiousness</code>.</p> <p>::: info An alternative writing is \u4e0d\u7528\u5fc3. They should mean the same thing. ::: But this particular word <code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3</code> tends to mean</p> <p>lack of cautiousness in relation to criminal or other hostile activity.</p> <p>So we might say that walking alone in a dangerous place is <code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3</code></p> <p>or leaving valuables on display in our car is <code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3</code>.</p> <p>And here, leaving her door unlocked at night so anybody could just walk in is <code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3</code>.</p> <p><code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3\u3060\u306a</code>: <code>\u306a</code>, as we know, is the particle used for directing a comment at ourself,</p> <p>so she's thinking to herself <code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3\u3060</code> -- it's reckless, dangerous behavior.</p> <p><code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3\u3060\u306a\u3001\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u5f7c\u5973\u306f</code>: so, she, who was thinking this,</p> <p><code>\u96fb\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u3066\u5148\u8f29\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u305d\u3046\u304b\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u304c</code>.</p> <p>All right, so this looks a little bit complicated and we still haven't finished the sentence,</p> <p>but let's just take it bit by bit.</p> <p>First of all she thought <code>\u7121\u7528\u5fc3</code> -- <code>unsafe, dangerous behavior</code>; <code>she thought</code> --</p> <p><code>\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u5f7c\u5973</code> -- she who thought that, then thought something else; <code>\u96fb\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u3066</code> --</p> <p><code>\u70b9\u3051\u308b/\u3064\u3051\u308b</code>, of course, is the other-move version of <code>\u70b9\u304f/\u3064\u304f</code>,</p> <p>so she thought of switching on the lights;</p> <p><code>\u5148\u8f29\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u305d\u3046</code> -- now, as we know, that <code>\u305d\u3046</code> ending is a volitional ending;</p> <p><code>\u8d77\u3053\u305d\u3046\u304b</code> -- she thought about taking the action of awakening senpai.</p> <p><code>\u8d77\u3053\u3059</code> --to <code>wake someone up</code>; <code>\u8d77\u304d\u308b</code>, you wake up yourself;</p> <p><code>\u8d77\u3053\u3059</code> -- -\u3059 endings, as we know, mean other-move verbs,</p> <p>so <code>\u8d77\u3053\u3059</code> is to wake someone else up.</p> <p><code>\u8d77\u3053\u305d\u3046\u304b</code> -- so, she's thinking about this action.</p> <p></p> <p>The <code>\u304b</code>, as we know from another lesson (Lesson 39), marks a question, that's to say, a proposition.</p> <p>So the proposition was taking the action of waking up senpai.</p> <p>This is what she thought, but... (<code>\u304c</code> -- <code>but</code>) <code>\u5148\u8f29\u304c\u304b\u306a\u308a\u9154\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306e\u3092\u304a\u3082\u3044\u3060\u3057\u3001</code>.</p> <p>So, <code>\u304b\u306a\u308a</code> is another one of those adverbial nouns that can modify a verb or an adjective</p> <p>without the \u306b or -\u3068 that's usually needed for a noun to modify a verb or an adjective,</p> <p>so <code>\u304b\u306a\u308a\u9154\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f</code> -- <code>\u9154\u3046</code> is to <code>be sick or to be drunk</code>, in this case <code>drunk</code>.</p> <p><code>\u304b\u306a\u308a</code> means <code>sufficiently</code> or <code>pretty much</code> or <code>very</code>.</p> <p>So she was pretty drunk, she was in the state of being pretty drunk: <code>\u304b\u306a\u308a\u9154\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306e</code> -- the <code>\u306e</code> of course bundles that statement into a noun box -- <code>\u306e\u3092\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3057</code> --</p> <p><code>\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3057</code> is <code>remember</code>, so she remembered the fact -- the <code>\u306e</code> --</p> <p>that senpai had been pretty drunk.</p> <p><code>\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3059</code> is <code>remember</code>;

<p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to talk about some exceptions in Japanese,</p> <p>how they work, and why they're there.</p> <p>And in doing that, I think we're going to gain some insight into</p> <p>how Japanese holds together and how we can understand it.</p> <p>So what we're going to talk about today is</p> <p>\u898b\u308b, \u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b, \u898b\u308c\u308b, \u898b\u3048\u308b, \u805e\u304f, \u805e\u3051\u308b, \u805e\u3053\u3048\u308b.</p> <p>Now, that seems like quite a confusing lot of things, doesn't it?</p> <p>But in fact all we have there is the basic dictionary forms</p> <p>of <code>\u898b\u308b</code> and <code>\u805e\u304f</code> -- <code>see</code> and <code>hear</code> -- and the potential form of each</p> <p>and one alternative or exceptional potential form.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, it looks like two in the case of <code>\u898b\u308b</code>, but it's actually one,</p> <p>and we'll come to that in just a moment.</p> <p>I always say that Japanese is a very, very regular and logical language,</p> <p>and the conventional wisdom is that it only has two irregular verbs, <code>\u6765\u308b</code> and <code>\u3059\u308b</code>.</p> <p>Now, as I've mentioned before, it does in fact have a few other minor irregularities,</p> <p>and by minor irregularities what I mean is verbs that aren't really irregular verbs but</p> <p>they do become irregular in one particular area, in one single place only.</p> <p>And there aren't many of these, but there are a few and these are two of them.</p> <p>And we want to look at what they are and, more importantly,</p> <p>why they are what they are and what they mean,</p> <p>how we can understand them.</p> <p>So to start with, we understand how the regular potential form,</p> <p>the <code>able to do</code> form, of verbs work, don't we?</p> <p>We form it simply by turning the verb into its \u3048-stem and</p> <p>adding the very simple potential helper verb <code>\u308b</code>, which is just one character: \u308b.</p> <p>That's the godan form.</p> <p>And the ichidan form: in the ichidan we do what we always do,</p> <p>we simply remove the -\u308b and put on whatever it is we're going to put on.</p> <p>In this case, the ichidan potential helper is <code></code>\u3089\u308c\u308b<code></code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So, as we can see, <code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> is the regular potential form of <code>\u898b\u308b</code>,</p> <p>which is an ichidan verb, and</p> <p><code>\u805e\u3051\u308b</code> is the regular potential form of <code>\u805e\u304f</code>, which is of course a godan verb.</p> <p>So why am I saying that there's only one variant of <code>\u898b\u308b</code> and not two?</p> <p>Well, that's because the variant is <code>\u898b\u3048\u308b</code>, and we'll come back to that in a moment.</p> <p><code>\u898b\u308c\u308b</code> is in fact the ichidan form being affected by a phenomenon which we call <code>\u3089\u629c\u304d</code>. <code>\u3089\u629c\u304d</code> means literally <code>taking out the \u3089</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And this is something that happens quite widely in Japanese.</p> <p>You're going to encounter it pretty often once you're actually using Japanese,</p> <p>so that may be right now.</p> <p>It simply consists of taking out the <code>\u3089</code>, dropping the <code>\u3089</code>,</p> <p>in the ichidan potential form of verbs.</p> <p>This is considered to be incorrect grammar, not only by the English Japanese textbooks</p> <p>but also by native Japanese grammar textbooks.</p> <p>It's considered to be incorrect grammar, but it's very, very widespread,</p> <p>much more widespread than most of the popular bits of incorrect grammar</p> <p>that you'll hear from time to time.</p> <p>And I would suggest that this is probably going to be an evolution of the language.</p> <p>Now, Western people often tend to say, \"Well, if a number of people</p> <p>are using an incorrect usage then how can you say it's incorrect?</p> <p>Surely it's a new correct usage, because correct is just what people use.\"</p> <p>And I think this is a mistake and a rather dangerous and irresponsible mistake,</p> <p>because while it's true that language evolves, the evolution of language is pretty much the same as the theorized evolution of species.</p> <p>That's to say, species evolve from mutations.</p> <p>Mutations happen relatively often and most of them die out.</p> <p>Only a few of them, and usually in cases where they have some special advantage,</p> <p>actually persist and become part of the evolution of the species.</p> <p>And the same is true of languages.</p> <p>Most incorrect usages that get taken up by largish numbers of people die out.</p> <p>Only a very few of them ever become parts of the real evolution of the language.</p> <p>So if you do what is currently being done in the West, which is put in misuses of language into dictionaries, what you're doing is actually short-circuiting the self-correcting function of language.</p> <p>Language over a generation or so, over maybe a couple of decades,</p> <p>will reject most uses that go against its basic logic.</p> <p>A very few of them will end up making minor changes in the basic logic.</p> <p>And that's why it's a mistake to put into dictionaries at an early stage</p> <p>misuses of language, because we have no way of knowing at that early stage</p> <p>whether they're really going to be genuine evolutions of language</p> <p>or whether they're going to die out within a generation.</p> <p>What we do know is that in most cases, in the vast majority of cases,</p> <p>they would die out within a generation, and by putting them into a dictionary we're interfering with that self-correcting process of language.</p> <p>And this, I would say, is important, because it's this way of thinking</p> <p>that makes Japanese teaching so very poor in the West.</p> <p>It's the way of thinking that assumes that language is a completely irrational thing</p> <p>that just happens to evolve in any way it chooses to evolve.</p> <p></p> <p>And it's not. Language is governed by logic.</p> <p>And Japanese is governed by logic more than most languages.</p> <p>But if you reject that notion, if you think that language is simply irrational</p> <p>and chance and accidental and anything anybody happens to use is as correct as anything else,</p> <p>then you end up teaching language as if it were just a hodgepodge of things</p> <p>that you have to learn because they just happen to be there</p> <p>and don't have any underlying logic.</p> <p>And that really is the fallacy that underlies modern Western Japanese teaching.</p> <p>So, that's a digression.</p> <p>Let's get back to <code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>.</p> <p><code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> is what they'll use, because that is currently the correct usage.</p> <p>So we have <code>\u898b\u308b</code>, we have <code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code><code>, and </code>\u898b\u3048\u308b\".</p> <p>We have <code>\u805e\u304f</code>, we have <code>\u805e\u3051\u308b</code> and we have <code>\u805e\u3053\u3048\u308b</code>.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/54-irregularities-how-they-work-%E8%A6%8B%E3%82%8B-%E8%A6%8B%E3%82%89%E3%82%8C%E3%82%8B-%E8%A6%8B%E3%82%8C%E3%82%8B-%E8%A6%8B%E3%81%88%E3%82%8B-%E8%81%9E%E3%81%8F-%E8%81%9E%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B-%E8%81%9E%E3%81%93%E3%81%88%E3%82%8B/#regular-and-irregular-potential-form","title":"Regular and irregular potential form","text":"<p>So what is the difference between the two potential forms,</p> <p>the regular and the irregular potential form?</p> <p>Now, in each case here, the irregular potential form is what I'm going to call a forced self-move form.</p> <p>Now, as we know from our lesson on the potential (Lesson 10), potential is usually self-move -- and if you don't know what <code>self-move</code> is,</p> <p>you should look at the lesson on self-move and other-move verbs too (Lesson 15).</p> <p>They sometimes get called, not exactly accurately, transitive and intransitive.</p> <p>So, for example, if we want to say <code>I can read the book</code>,</p> <p>in Japanese we actually say <code>the book does readable to me</code>.</p> <p>So we say <code>(\u79c1\u306f)\u672c\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u308b</code>. This is self-move.</p> <p>The book is the actor and it's acting upon itself.</p> <p>It's making itself readable, it's <code>doing readable</code> literally.</p> <p></p> <p>::: info The furigana of \u79c1 should be \u308f\u305f\u3057. ::: There's no exact English translation for this,</p> <p>because we're not saying the book IS readable;</p> <p>it's not an adjectival phrase.</p> <p>We're saying the book DOES readable.</p> <p>So we just have to get used to the fact that Japanese is much more happy than English</p> <p>to treat states of being as verbal actions.</p> <p>So if we want to say <code>I can read the book/As for me, the book does readable</code>, we say <code>(\u79c1\u306f)\u672c\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u308b</code>,</p> <p>but if we just want to say <code>I can read/I do readable</code>, we might say <code>\u8aad\u3081\u308b</code> or <code>(\u79c1\u306f)\u79c1\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u308b</code>,</p> <p>and again we have a self-move verb.</p> <p></p> <p>In one case we're saying <code>I do readable (I am able to read)</code>,</p> <p>in the other we say <code>the book does readable (the book does being able to be read)</code></p> <p>and that's how it works.</p> <p>However, it is also possible to use the potential in other-move contexts.</p> <p>Usually this happens in modifying clauses.</p> <p>These are sometimes called by Western textbooks <code>subordinate clauses</code>,</p> <p>which they are, but I think it's better and clearer to call them <code>modifying clauses</code>,</p> <p>and I've done quite a lot of work on modifying clauses,</p> <p>so I'd recommend this video if you want to know exactly what I mean.</p> <p>So, in modifying clauses particularly</p> <p>we can use the potential as an other-move verb.</p> <p>For example, we might say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3092\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u65e5\u3092\u697d\u3057\u307f\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b</code></p> <p>This means <code>I'm looking forward to the day when I can see Sakura.</code></p> <p></p> <p>And as you see, here we're saying <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3092\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>, using <code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>, the potential,</p> <p><code>being able to see Sakura</code>, as an other-move verb with an object, which is Sakura.</p> <p>Now, we can do that with <code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>, we can do that with <code>\u805e\u3051\u308b</code>,</p> <p>but we can't do it with <code>\u898b\u3048\u308b</code> or <code>\u805e\u3053\u3048\u308b</code>.</p> <p>They are forced to be used as self-move verbs only.</p> <p>And on the whole, because potential verbs mostly are self-move in Japanese,</p> <p>whether we're talking about something else or whether we're talking about ourselves,</p> <p>we use them in a self-move manner, those two are the most commonly used.</p> <p>Actually we can use the other forms, the regular forms,</p> <p><code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> and <code>\u805e\u3051\u308b</code>, as self-move verbs too,</p> <p>but they can also be used as other-move verbs.</p> <p>With <code>\u898b\u3048\u308b</code> and <code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>, there is a difference in nuance, which is that</p> <p><code>\u898b\u3048\u308b</code> usually means being able, actually physically able, to see something,</p> <p>and <code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code> more implies having the opportunity to see something.</p> <p>So if we were to say <code>\u829d\u5c45/\u3057\u3070\u3044\u304c\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>,</p> <p>we're saying I have the opportunity to see the play.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u829d\u5c45\u304c\u898b\u3048\u308b</code>, we might mean</p> <p>the lady in front of me has taken off her big hat so I'm able to see the play.</p> <p>However, this alone wouldn't be, I think, sufficient reason</p> <p>for these two variants of the words surviving into modern Japanese.</p> <p>The important reason, which is based in the very nature of seeing and hearing</p> <p>and expressions we use in connection with seeing and hearing, is this:</p> <p>they are both used in places where in English we would say</p> <p>that something <code>looks like</code> something or something <code>sounds like</code> something.</p> <p>You can't use the standard versions <code>\u805e\u3051\u308b</code> and <code>\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b</code>\" for this.</p> <p>You have to use these variants.</p> <p>So if you say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u30ab\u30a8\u30eb\u306b\u898b\u3048\u308b</code>, you're saying <code>Sakura looks like a frog</code>.</p> <p>So when we say <code>looks like</code>, we use the targeting particle \u306b with a noun,</p> <p>or with an adjective we use the \u304f-stem of the adjective.</p> <p>So we say <code>\u30ab\u30a8\u30eb\u306b\u898b\u3048\u308b</code> -- <code>looks like a frog</code> --</p> <p>or we can say of someone <code>\u82e5\u304f\u898b\u3048\u308b</code> -- <code>she looks young</code>.</p> <p>And we can also use it not just for literally how something sounds to our ears</p> <p>or for how something looks to our eyes, but what its appearance is.</p> <p>So we can say <code>\u5947\u5999/\u304d\u307f\u3087\u3046\u306b\u805e\u3053\u3048\u308b</code> -- <code>it sounds strange / sounds peculiar</code>.</p> <p>So, we're not talking here necessarily about the actual sound.</p> <p>It might not be a noise that sounds strange.</p> <p>It may be something somebody said that sounds strange.</p> <p>So we're using either the adverbial form of an adjective or the adjective-making targeting particle \u306b to describe how something appears to us, how something sounds to us, literally or figuratively.</p> <p>And this is the real reason for the survival of these alternative forms of the potential.</p> <p>They have this specific meaning, which the other form, the regular form, can't have.</p> <p>And it's not a coincidence that it's this forced, must-be self-move version</p> <p>that takes on that meaning, because the way something else looks,</p> <p>the way something else sounds, always has to be self-move.</p> <p>We're not talking about anything we do to the look or anything we do to the sound,</p> <p>but about how it looks and sounds in itself.</p> <p>So this extremely self-move version (\u898b\u3048\u308b/\u805e\u3053\u3048\u308b), which can't be used in other-move contexts, is what is used in the case of both seeing and hearing to describe</p> <p>how something sounds to us and how something looks to us.</p> <p>::: info in the comments,

\u7528\u8a00","text":"<p>However, there's another way of dividing Japanese words which is used in Japanese grammar and that is into <code>\u4f53\u8a00</code> and <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>, which literally means <code>body words</code> and <code>use words</code>, but the terms I'm going to employ is <code>static words</code> or <code>static elements</code></p> <p>and <code>active words</code> or <code>active elements</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, static or body words essentially boil down to nouns,</p> <p>so in a way this underlines the noun-centered structure of Japanese,</p> <p>because we divide them into nouns and the rest, the other two.</p> <p>And it's very easy to see how this works.</p> <p>By <code>active words</code> what we mean is those words that can transform, that can modify.</p> <p>And that applies to both adjectives and verbs.</p> <p>And in fact they transform in very much the same way.</p> <p>In both cases the thing that transforms is always the last kana of the word.</p> <p>And we know that both verbs and adjectives must always end in a kana.</p> <p>They can't be all kanji, otherwise they'd be nouns.</p> <p>All verbs end in an \u3046-row kana; all adjectives end in the kana \u3044.</p> <p>And that is the part, and the only part, that changes.</p> <p>With godan verbs, the \u3046-row kana changes to its equivalent in one of the other rows.</p> <p>So, -\u3059 can become -\u3055, -\u3057, -\u305b or -\u305d.</p> <p>And ichidan verbs simply drop the -\u308b.</p> <p>Verbs can also modify into the \u3066-form, and again this is essentially a question of either</p> <p>changing or dropping the final kana and adding -\u3066 or \u3067.</p> <p>And the same of course with \u305f-form.</p> <p>Adjectives can change the -\u3044 to -\u304f, -\u304b or -\u3051,</p> <p>so we can have <code>\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u304f</code>, <code>\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> or <code>\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3051\u308c\u3070</code>.</p> <p>Or we can drop the -\u3044 altogether and add something else, as for example in <code>\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u305d\u3046</code>.</p> <p>Nouns, on the other hand, can't modify at all.</p> <p>You can't do anything with the last kana of a noun or any other part of a noun</p> <p>in terms of grammatical modification.</p> <p>But you can add logical particles to a noun</p> <p>and you can also add the copula <code>\u3060</code> or <code>\u3067\u3059</code> to a noun.</p> <p>So, we have two sets of words:</p> <p>the <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>, the active words which you can modify by changing the final kana and adding something but you can't add logical particles or the copula to these,</p> <p>and nouns and also pronouns and other noun-like entities, <code>\u4f53\u8a00</code> or static words,</p> <p>which you can't modify but you can add logical particles or the copula.</p> <p>And it's important to understand that when we add the logical particle or the copula</p> <p>to a noun we regard those two things joined together as a unit.</p> <p>So for example when we add the soft copula <code>\u306a</code> to an adjectival noun like <code>\u7dba\u9e97/\u304d\u308c\u3044</code></p> <p>we have <code>\u7dba\u9e97\u306a</code>, and <code>\u7dba\u9e97\u306a</code> is regarded as a unit in itself.</p> <p></p> <p>And actually that unit could be called a <code>\u306a-adjective</code>, because <code>\u7dba\u9e97</code> plus <code>\u306a</code> or <code>\u3060</code> becomes an adjectival unit.</p> <p>So although I very much object to the term <code>\u306a-adjective</code> in the way it's used by Western textbooks, which is to say they will tell you that <code>\u7dba\u9e97</code> is a <code>\u306a-adjective</code>, and it's not</p> <p>-- it's a noun, it's not any kind of an adjective --</p> <p>we could say that <code>\u7dba\u9e97\u306a</code> or <code>\u7dba\u9e97\u3060</code> is a \u306a-adjective.</p> <p>I would not recommend it, simply because the term is so abused</p> <p>in Western so-called Japanese grammar that it's best left alone.</p> <p>It has a name in Japanese but since it would take rather a while to explain it,</p> <p>I won't go into that here. But it's not anything like <code>\u306a-adjective</code>.</p> <p>Now, the other thing to understand is that when we attach the copula to a noun,</p> <p>that combination is in fact a <code>\u7528\u8a00</code> or active unit.</p> <p></p> <p>And that's obvious, because once you've attached the copula to it,</p> <p>we can in fact modify it.</p> <p>The copula has a \u3066-form, which is <code>\u3067</code>, so <code>\u7dba\u9e97\u306a</code> can become <code>\u7dba\u9e97\u3067</code> in order to conjoin it to something else.</p> <p>We can also modify <code>\u7dba\u9e97\u3060</code> into, say, <code>\u7dba\u9e97\u3060\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p>So, once we attach the copula to a noun, we have a <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>, an active unit,</p> <p>and as I'm sure you have already worked out by now,</p> <p>this means that the three engines, the three possible ways of ending a sentence,</p> <p>are all <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>, or active units. That's to say, verb, adjective and noun-plus-copula.</p> <p></p> <p>These are the three possible engines of a sentence</p> <p>and they are also the three possible <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>.</p> <p>We tend to call them <code>\u7528\u8a00</code> when they're modifying something else,</p> <p>when they're inside a sentence.</p> <p>So, armed with this information, we can now take a deeper look at the particle \u3067.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/55-secrets-of-the-%E3%81%A7-particle-why-do-we-say-%E3%81%BF%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A7%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%8F-and-%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E3%81%A7%E4%B8%80%E7%95%AA/#a-deeper-look-into-the-particle","title":"A deeper look into the particle \u3067","text":"<p>When I introduced it in the video on logical particles (Lesson 8b),</p> <p>I said that it, like the other logical particles other than \u304c (which, of course, is in every sentence) and \u306e (which is a logical particle, but it doesn't tell us what its noun is doing in relation to the action of the sentence; it tells us about the noun in relation to another noun)</p> <p>but the other particles, including \u3067, I said,</p> <p>were only active in A-does-B sentences, that's verb-sentences.</p> <p>Now, that is something of an oversimplification.</p> <p>There is another way in which they can act.</p> <p>It doesn't become too much of a problem not knowing that at the beginning,</p> <p>but as we progress we need to understand this.</p> <p>And in order to understand it we need to know what we've just learned.</p> <p>We need to know about <code>\u4f53\u8a00</code> and <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>, static and active elements.</p> <p>Because the truth is not that \u3067 is absolutely restricted to verb-sentences,</p> <p>A-does-B sentences, although most of the time it is.</p> <p>What it's restricted to is clauses that modify <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>.</p> <p>And the <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>, as we know, can be a verb, but it can also be an adjective</p> <p>or even an adjectival noun-plus-copula.</p> <p>And there are some cases where this happens.</p> <p>So what is \u3067 actually doing?</p> <p>Well, as we know, there are three positional logical particles,</p> <p>and they are the targeting particle \u306b (which tells us where something goes to or where it is, where it stays once it's got there), there is \u3078, which is the directional particle, and there is \u3067.</p> <p>And what \u3067 really does is tells us the boundary or limit within which something happens.</p> <p>Usually that's a physical boundary, a physical area, though it doesn't always have to be.</p> <p>So, \u306b tells where a noun (person, animal, thing) is headed to or where it's located;</p> <p>\u3078 tells us direction in which it's going;</p> <p>\u3067 tells us the boundary within which an action or a state of being takes place.</p> <p>It's usually an action, so that's how we introduce it, but it can be a state of being.</p> <p>In other words, it can be an adjectival.</p> <p>So for example let's take the phrase <code>\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u4e00\u756a\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3</code>.</p> <p>Now, people will ask, <code>Why \u3067? Why are we using \u3067 in this case?</code></p> <p>And the answer is that <code>\u4e16\u754c\u3067</code> -- and remember that</p> <p>we always treat a logical particle plus the noun it's attached to as a unit --</p> <p><code>\u4e16\u754c\u3067</code> is defining the limit within which something is happening,</p> <p>but in this case it's defining the limit within which a state of being applies.</p> <p>So we're talking about <code>the most delicious ramen in the world</code>.</p> <p><code>The world/\u4e16\u754c</code> is the limit we're applying.</p> <p>And in this case, of course, with <code>the world</code> we're trying to give as big a limit as possible.</p> <p>But we might say, <code>\u3053\u306e\u753a\u3067\u4e00\u756a\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3</code></p> <p>and then we're saying <code>the most delicious ramen in this town</code>.</p> <p>So we've drawn a boundary around it.</p> <p>We're not saying it's the most delicious ramen possible, but we are saying within certain limits, within the limits of this town, it's the most delicious ramen.</p> <p>So that's what \u3067 is doing.</p> <p>Just as with an action it tells us where the action takes place, the locality, the boundary within which it takes place, with the other kind of <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>, an adjectival,</p> <p>it's telling us the boundary within which that adjectival quality prevails.</p> <p>Now, we can also say <code>\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u4e00\u756a\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3</code>.</p> <p>That's less commonly said, but it could be said.</p> <p>And what that means is <code>the most delicious ramen of the world</code>,</p> <p>but the point to understand here is that \u3067 is drawing the boundaries of the <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>, the active element, the verb or in this case the adjective; \u306e is doing something different.</p> <p>We know what \u306e does: it links one noun to another.</p> <p>So it's not modifying the quality of <code>\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044</code>, as \u3067 is.</p> <p>It's modifying <code>\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3</code>.</p> <p>And because of this we can also say <code>\u3053\u306e\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u306f\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u4e00\u756a\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044</code></p> <p>-- we're saying <code>This ramen is the most delicious in the world.</code></p> <p>But we can't say <code>\u3053\u306e\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u306f\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u4e00\u756a\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044</code></p> <p></p> <p>Why can't we?</p> <p>Because, as we know from the lesson on word order (Lesson 46),</p> <p>in Japanese words only modify words that come after them.</p> <p>They can't modify words that come before them.</p> <p>And because \u306e can't modify <code>\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044</code>, it can only modify <code>\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3</code>, which is another noun, and because <code>\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3</code> is on the wrong side of it, we can't actually use that.</p> <p>So we have to say <code>\u3053\u306e\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u306f\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u4e00\u756a\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044</code>,</p> <p>because \u3067 sets the boundary within which <code>\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044</code> prevails.</p> <p>Now, since we know that a noun-plus-copula also functions as a <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>, an active element,</p> <p>we can also say <code>\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u4e00\u756a\u6709\u540d\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9</code>.</p> <p>And in this case, <code>\u4e16\u754c\u3067</code> is modifying <code>\u6709\u540d\u306a</code>.</p> <p>It couldn't modify <code>\u6709\u540d</code> on its own, because <code>\u6709\u540d</code> is a noun, but it can modify <code>\u6709\u540d\u306a</code>.</p> <p>So it's telling us the boundaries within which this fame operates.</p> <p><code>She's the most famous android in the world</code>.</p> <p>She may not be the most famous android in the Solar System,</p> <p>but she is the most famous android in the world.</p> <p>Now the same happens when we say something like <code>\u307f\u3093\u306a\u3067\u8e0a\u308b</code> -- <code>we all dance</code>.</p> <p>Why do we say <code>\u307f\u3093\u306a\u3067</code>?</p> <p>Well, if we say <code>\u4e8c\u4eba\u3067\u8e0a\u308b</code>, we're saying <code>two of us dance</code>.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u4e00\u4eba\u3067\u8e0a\u308b</code>, we're saying <code>dance alone</code>.</p> <p>The quantitative sentence plus \u3067 is describing the limits of the people who do it.</p> <p>So, as I said before, the boundary or area or demarcation that \u3067 draws for us</p> <p>is usually a physical one, a place.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u90e8\u5c4b\u3067\u8e0a\u308b</code>, we're saying <code>I dance in the room.</code></p> <p>But if we say <code>\u4e00\u4eba\u3067\u8e0a\u308b</code>, we're saying <code>I dance alone.</code></p> <p>In both cases we're drawing a boundary to say what are the limits.</p> <p>The physical limits are the room,</p> <p>and the numerical or quantitative limits are <code>\u4e00\u4eba</code>, <code>\u4e8c\u4eba</code>, <code>\u307f\u3093\u306a</code> etc.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/56-agility-deeper-secrets-of-%E3%81%AF-and-%E3%81%AE-particles/","title":"56. <code>Agility</code>: Deeper secrets of \u306f and \u306e particles","text":"<p><code>Agility</code>: The Vital Language Factor No One Mentions.

Why not?</p> <p>Because this <code>speaking of</code> in English is not agile at all.</p> <p>It's setting up a rather dramatic and heavy, cumbersome way of introducing a subject.</p> <p>We can't just keep saying <code>speaking of</code> in a sentence,</p> <p>because <code>speaking of</code> and the various other ways</p> <p>that we introduce topics in English are not agile.</p> <p>Japanese \u306f is very, very agile.</p> <p>We can freely throw it in wherever we want to create a distinction like this,</p> <p>because \u306f distinguishes things.</p> <p>When we change a topic using \u306f, we are implicitly saying that</p> <p>the comment on the new topic is different from the comment on the old topic.</p> <p>If we want to say that the comment is the same,</p> <p>then we have to use the other topic-marker, \u3082.</p> <p></p> <p>And this sentence actually doubles down on that</p> <p>by giving a \u306f to both the compounded logical clauses.</p> <p>So we're saying <code>speaking of lions...</code> this topic has a comment</p> <p>which is different from another topic that may be nearby.</p> <p>But <code>speaking of lions, they exist</code>,</p> <p>and then <code>speaking of tigers...</code> this topic also has a comment</p> <p>that will differ from the comment on any nearby topic: <code>they don't exist</code>.</p> <p>Now, as you see, this is a very cumbersome process if we think about it in English.</p> <p>But if we understand it in Japanese, if we know how the \u306f-particle is used lightly and</p> <p>easily and agilely in this kind of circumstance, it ceases to be a problem.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/56-agility-deeper-secrets-of-%E3%81%AF-and-%E3%81%AE-particles/#particle_1","title":"Particle \u306e","text":"<p>Now, another area where we often get confusion because of the agility of a Japanese element</p> <p>in comparison to any way we would imitate it in English is the \u306e-particle,</p> <p>the so-called nominalizing \u306e,</p> <p>which acts as a pronoun and bundles everything coming before it,</p> <p>everything modifying it, into a noun-box, into a single noun-like entity.</p> <p>And one of my patrons asked me this question, and it's a short sentence and it ought to be fairly simple, but my patron found it quite difficult, and I think a lot of people find this sort of thing quite difficult.</p> <p>Not because it is difficult, not because the structure is actually hard to parse,</p> <p>but because it's very unlike what we would do in English or many other languages, under the same circumstances.</p> <p>So, this comes from a Disney song, <code>The Bells of Notre Dame</code>,</p> <p>and the first line is <code>\u671d\u306e\u30d1\u30ea\u306b\u97ff\u304f\u306e\u306f\u9418\u3060\u3088</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So, as you see, this is quite a short and simple-looking sentence.</p> <p>But can you see where the A and the B of this sentence are?</p> <p>My patron suggested that this meant <code>A bell resounds in morning Paris</code></p> <p>and that's more the sort of thing we would be saying in English.</p> <p>But we can see that this is in fact an A-is-B sentence and we can see also that it has a \u306f-marked topic and that the \u306f-marked topic comes quite near the end.</p> <p>So the A-is-B, the logical structure, has to come after the \u306f-marked topic.</p> <p>So what's the \u306f-marked topic?</p> <p>The \u306f-marked topic is <code>\u671d\u306e\u30d1\u30ea\u306b\u97ff\u304f\u306e</code>.</p> <p>So \u306e is bundling the rest of it, <code>in morning-Paris-resounds\u306e</code>,</p> <p>in other words <code>that which resounds in morning Paris</code>.</p> <p>And then of course we must have a logical \u304c-marked subject</p> <p>which has been defined for us by that \u306e.</p> <p>So, <code>that which resounds in morning Paris, it is (or they are) bells, \u3088.</code></p> <p></p> <p>So why is it being put in this way?</p> <p>You might say, because it can be.</p> <p>In English, this is difficult.</p> <p>In English, <code>that which resounds in morning Paris, that's bells</code> doesn't sound natural at all.</p> <p>And the reason is because setting up a topic like</p> <p><code>that which resounds in morning Paris</code> is not straightforward in English.</p> <p>It's not agile; it's cumbersome; it's large; it's slow-footed.</p> <p>But in Japanese we do this all the time.</p> <p>We say things like <code>That which she saw when she went into the room was...</code></p> <p>Now, in English we're much more likely to say</p> <p><code>When she went into the room she saw...</code></p> <p>or <code>In Paris in the morning bells resound throughout the city.</code></p> <p>If we want to use this <code>that which...</code> kind of structure,</p> <p>we have to have built up to it.</p> <p>If we, for example, have spent some time establishing</p> <p>the fact that she's nervous about what she's going to see</p> <p>when she opens the door and looks into the room, then we can say</p> <p><code>What she saw when she looked in the room was...</code></p> <p>But we need to have set that up.</p> <p>We need to have made some kind of preparation to use that form,</p> <p>because it's not agile.</p> <p>It's not a lightweight thing that we can just slip in anywhere.</p> <p>On the other hand, Japanese can use this as a narrative technique,</p> <p>setting up anticipation of what she saw and resolving it very quickly over the course of a short sentence and without making any fuss about it, because it's a light, agile verbal formula.</p> <p>And because of that, you're going to see it all over the place in Japanese,</p> <p>so you need to get used to it.</p> <p>But really the important point of this lesson</p> <p>is the concept of agility itself,</p> <p></p> <p>because we're going to come across in Japanese as we go forward</p> <p>various cases where Japanese uses expression strategies which may seem very unnatural and strange when you try to translate them into English,</p> <p>because the English equivalents are not agile</p> <p>and the Japanese equivalents are very agile and lightweight.</p> <p>And one of the things about being agile and lightweight</p> <p>is not so much that it's easy to say in itself</p> <p>but that it's easy to shoehorn into the middle of saying something else.</p> <p>In other words, it doesn't have to be the main point of the statement.</p> <p>In English you can't say things like <code>speaking of...</code> or <code>as for...</code></p> <p>unless that's going to be the main point of the statement.</p> <p>But in Japanese you can because it's lighter, it's more agile\u2026</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/57-%E8%BE%BC%E3%82%80-komu-and-the-secret-of-multi-meaning-japanese-words/","title":"57. \u8fbc\u3080

we're going to talk about one word in particular that has a lot of different meanings in different contexts and can be attached to other words.</p> <p>But, more than that, we're going to talk about how this kind of word works and how we can understand them.</p> <p>We often see in dictionaries words that have a whole range of different and apparently unconnected meanings.</p> <p>I'm not talking about homophones here, where the kanji are different.</p> <p>They may not be related, though they sometimes are.</p> <p>But I'm talking about words that actually are the same word</p> <p>but have a range of different meanings.</p> <p>And in these cases the important thing to understand</p> <p>is that normally there's going to be a base, concrete meaning</p> <p>and then from that a number of metaphorical meanings.</p> <p>And this isn't just a side issue with human language.</p> <p>Human language, whenever it discusses abstraction,</p> <p>uses words that are based in concrete, physical metaphors.</p> <p>And we may sometimes forget the concrete, physical metaphors,</p> <p>but they're always there.</p> <p>Even when we talk about time, we have to talk about it in terms of space.</p> <p>We talk about time <code>going forward</code> or <code>going backward</code>.</p> <p>We talk about a time <code>line</code> -- a line is an entity that exists in space.</p> <p>We can't actually discuss time without discussing it in terms of space.</p> <p>And this continues with all other abstractions in human languages.</p> <p>The word <code>focus</code> originally means a <code>hearth</code>.</p> <p>People used to sit around the hearth fire</p> <p>and that would be at the center, the focus of their activity.</p> <p>And from that physical metaphor come all the extended</p> <p>and abstract meanings of the word <code>focus</code>.</p> <p>The word <code>stimulus</code> originally meant an <code>ox-goad</code>,</p> <p>a pointed stick that you would drive oxen along with.</p> <p>And from that come all the abstract meanings of <code>stimulus</code>.</p> <p><code>Politics</code> comes from a word that simply means <code>city</code>.</p> <p><code>Economics</code> comes from a word that simply means <code>house</code>.</p> <p>Now, we don't need to know the physical metaphors on which words like this are based,</p> <p>but when we come across words in Japanese that seem to have different and contradictory meanings, we do need to understand the basic metaphor</p> <p>in order to grasp the other meanings</p> <p>without learning them as a long laundry-list of apparently random things.</p> <p>So, if we see the word <code>\u5207\u308b</code> in a dictionary -- which means <code>cut</code> --</p> <p>we see lots and lots of meanings for it like <code>ending a conversation</code>,</p> <p><code>severing a relationship</code>, <code>crossing a field</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And all of these just come from the basic meaning of <code>cut</code>.</p> <p>Even in English we talk about <code>cutting across a field</code>.</p> <p>Now, that's easy enough, so long as we understand the principle,</p> <p>with a word like <code>cut</code>, where we have a very definite,</p> <p>clear-cut (if I may say so) equivalent in English.</p> <p>But when we come to words which don't have an exact English equivalent,</p> <p>it can get a bit harder unless we understand what they mean.</p> <p>And one of those words, which we're going to see</p> <p>everywhere in Japanese, is the word <code>\u8fbc\u3080</code>.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/57-%E8%BE%BC%E3%82%80-komu-and-the-secret-of-multi-meaning-japanese-words/#_1","title":"\u8fbc\u3080","text":"<p>Now, <code>\u8fbc\u3080</code>

metaphor,</p> <p>because literally it means <code>middle</code> or <code>center</code> or <code>inside</code>.</p> <p>But in this case, when it's attached to a verb like this,</p> <p><code>\u4e2d</code> means <code>in the process of</code>.</p> <p>As we might say in English, <code>in the middle of doing something</code>.</p> <p><code>\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u4e2d</code> is <code>being in the process of \u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080-ing</code>,</p> <p>and <code>\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080</code> here means <code>loading</code>.</p> <p>It means <code>reading and cramming in</code>:</p> <p>reading data and putting it into memory.</p> <p>But the word has various other meanings, and while they are different,</p> <p>they're all based on the same fundamental metaphor.</p> <p>So <code>\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080</code> can mean reading something several times, reading it thoroughly.</p> <p><code>\u8fbc\u3080</code> can mean doing something repeatedly,</p> <p>because again it's cramming in iterations of doing it,</p> <p>cramming in reps, you might say.</p> <p>But it can mean reading thoroughly, it can mean reading repeatedly,</p> <p>in any case it means cramming the subject matter into your mind.</p> <p>And again, <code>\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080</code> can mean reading something into something:</p> <p>somebody says something or you see a text,</p> <p>and you put in extra meaning which you believe to be there.</p> <p>And very often it is. Texts can have implications.</p> <p>Reading something into something again can be <code>\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080</code>.</p> <p>And again it's a very obvious and natural use of the metaphor.</p> <p>And once again, <code>\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080</code> can mean</p> <p>reading poetry or something with feeling, with emotion.</p> <p>You're not just reading it; you're putting something into it,</p> <p>you're putting in the emotion, you're cramming it with something,</p> <p>with emotion, with feeling, with expression.</p> <p>So, all these meanings of <code>\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080</code> are different</p> <p>and yet all of them essentially conform to the same metaphor:</p> <p>read and cram something in.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/57-%E8%BE%BC%E3%82%80-komu-and-the-secret-of-multi-meaning-japanese-words/#_5","title":"\u601d\u3044\u8fbc\u3080","text":"<p>Now, another common compounded verb with <code>\u8fbc\u3080</code> is <code>\u601d\u3044\u8fbc\u3080</code>.</p> <p>Now, the most common use of that, I would say,</p> <p>is to <code>be under the impression / to be convinced of</code> something,</p> <p>usually something that turns out not to be true, but that doesn't have to be the case.</p> <p>So, <code>\u601d\u3044</code> is <code>thought</code> and <code>\u8fbc\u3080</code> is <code>cramming in</code>,</p> <p>so you have this thought crammed in, or this set of thoughts crammed into your mind.</p> <p>Whether they're true or not, they're in there, they're lodged in your mind.</p> <p>And, interestingly, in older English, people sometimes used to talk about <code>cramming</code> someone,</p> <p>meaning filling them up with wrong ideas, giving them false impressions,</p> <p>cramming into their mind a particular set of ideas which would generally not be correct,</p> <p>at least in the opinion of the speaker.</p> <p>So <code>\u601d\u3044\u8fbc\u3080</code> in that sense usually means</p> <p>having a strong impression, a strong belief, a strong notion</p> <p>that something is the case that probably in fact isn't.</p> <p>But <code>\u601d\u3044\u8fbc\u3080</code> can mean other things as well.</p> <p>It can mean <code>being in love</code> and it can mean <code>having one's heart set</code> on something.</p> <p>And in order to understand that, we need to know</p> <p>a little more about the word <code>\u601d\u3044</code>, which,</p> <p>as I pointed out toward the end of another video,</p> <p>doesn't necessarily just mean <code>thought</code> or <code>feeling</code>.</p> <p>It can also mean <code>love</code> or <code>desire</code>.</p> <p>So, for example, the word <code>\u7247\u601d\u3044</code> means <code>one-sided love</code>.</p> <p><code>\u7247</code> generally means <code>side</code> or <code>direction</code></p> <p>and <code>\u7247\u601d\u3044</code> is <code>one-sided or one-directional love / unrequited love</code>.</p> <p>So <code>\u601d\u3044</code> there is being used in the sense of <code>love / affection / desire</code>.</p> <p>So <code>\u601d\u3044\u8fbc\u3080</code> can mean <code>being in love</code>.</p> <p>It can also mean <code>having one's heart set on something</code>,</p> <p>and that doesn't necessarily mean loving a person.</p> <p>It could mean having one's heart set on going on a picnic, or anything.</p> <p>The point here is that <code>\u601d\u3044</code> in the sense of desire and love is crammed into one.

This is completely direct.</p> <p>I do the hitting and I'm hitting something, I'm hitting Sakura.</p> <p>I'm not hitting to Sakura or hitting at Sakura or hitting by Sakura.</p> <p>I'm directly hitting Sakura.</p> <p>Now, because of the directness of these two particles</p> <p>they can't have a non-logical particle appended to them.</p> <p>So, if you want to use a non-logical particle here, you can do it.</p> <p>But the way you do it is always by simply attaching the non-logical particle</p> <p>and leaving the logical particle out.</p> <p>And because these are so fundamental to every sentence,</p> <p>they can be understood by the hearer in Japanese.</p> <p>So, if we say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u306a\u3050\u3063\u305f</code>-- <code>I hit Sakura</code> --</p> <p>this means <code> (zero\u304c) \u3055\u304f\u3089\u306fzero\u3092\u306a\u3050\u3063\u305f</code>,</p> <p></p> <p>but we don't say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u3092\u306a\u3050\u3063\u305f</code> or <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3092\u306f\u306a\u3050\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p>Because you can't put anything between these two direct fundamental logical particles</p> <p>and the thing they directly connect to.</p> <p>So now we understand the basis for practically all</p> <p>the strange rules that you're going to hear about.</p> <p>You just need to remember these two facts:</p> <p>you can't pair one of these main five logical particles with any of the other four</p> <p>and you can't put a non-logical particle before or after the two primary particles \u304c and \u3092.</p> <p>Now, once we know that, what have we got left and how does it work?</p> <p>We can pair non-logical particles with any of the remaining logical particles.</p> <p>And the reason we're doing this is not to make</p> <p>some kind of weird, unusual pair-combination.</p> <p>We're simply using the functions of both at the same time.</p> <p>So the most straightforward thing we do here is simply make something into a topic.</p> <p>If we say <code> (zero\u304c) \u51ac\u306b\u306f\u96ea\u3060\u308b\u307e\u3092\u4f5c\u308b</code>, we're saying <code>In the winter we make a snowman.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, we could say <code> (zero\u304c) \u51ac\u306b\u96ea\u3060\u308b\u307e\u3092\u4f5c\u308b</code>.</p> <p>We don't have to have the \u306f there.</p> <p>So why would we choose sometimes to have a \u306f there?</p> <p>Well, in this case we're making it the topic of the sentence.</p> <p>We're saying <code>here's winter/speaking of winter, this is what we do.</code></p> <p>And it also plays the other roles that \u306f always plays as an extension of its topic-making nature.</p> <p>And I've done a video on these multiple uses of \u306f,</p> <p>so if you're not familiar with this, please take a look at it,</p> <p>because it's rather important for understanding what's going on here.</p> <p>So, we're making a topic out of the winter and</p> <p>we're also differentiating winter from other seasons.</p> <p>We're saying <code>\u51ac\u306b\u306f</code> -- <code>As for winter, as opposed to the other seasons, we make a snowman.</code></p> <p>Now, if the person you were talking to was someone</p> <p>from a very, very cold place, they might say</p> <p><code> (zero\u304c) \u6625\u306b\u3082\u96ea\u3060\u308b\u307e\u3092\u4f5c\u308b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So what they're saying is <code>We make a snowman in the spring as well.</code></p> <p>So we can use the exclusive particle \u306f or the inclusive particle \u3082.</p> <p>And both of them add that degree of meaning.</p> <p>Now why do we have the \u306b here?</p> <p>Because we actually need the \u306b.</p> <p>We need the \u306b to mark the fact that we're doing an activity at a particular time.</p> <p>This is the logical function of \u306b.</p> <p>And having done that, we can also make a topic out of it.</p> <p>And that's simply what we're doing here.</p> <p>In other cases we might say <code>\u660e\u65e5\u5b66\u6821\u306b\u884c\u304f</code></p> <p>and that simply means I'm going to school.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u660e\u65e5\u5b66\u6821\u306b\u306f\u884c\u304f</code>, the implication is that we're going to school but we're not going somewhere else that they thought we might be going.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u660e\u65e5\u5b66\u6821\u306b\u3082\u884c\u304f</code>, we're saying I'm going to school as well as somewhere else that you already know about.</p> <p>So you see, in each of these cases our non-logical particle</p> <p>is simply adding meaning to the logical particle that's already there.</p> <p>They don't clash, because one is logical and the other is non-logical,</p> <p>so they're not telling us conflicting information. They're telling us complementary information.</p> <p>And that's why you can use them that way and why</p> <p>you can't combine one logical particle with another logical particle</p> <p>or one non-logical particle with another non-logical particle.</p> <p>Now, there are other particles that can pair with other particles,</p> <p>but again, this whole pairing concept is the wrong way of looking at it.</p> <p>As always the particles are simply doing what they do.</p> <p>For example, the \u306e particle, if it's the nominalizing \u306e,</p> <p>the \u306e that turns something into a noun,</p> <p>so, for example, <code>\u6cf3\u3050\u306e</code> is <code>swimming</code>,</p> <p>the noun <code>swimming</code>, the activity called <code>swimming</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>We can say <code>\u6cf3\u3050\u306e\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059</code>.</p> <p>We can say <code>\u6cf3\u3050\u306e\u3092\u3057\u307e\u3059</code>.</p> <p>You can combine any logical particle with \u306e because that kind of \u306e turns the thing before it into what is effectively a noun, and a noun can take any of the logical particles.</p> <p>It could be a longer logical clause:</p> <p><code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u6cf3\u3050\u306e\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3060</code> --</p> <p><code>I like swimming together with Sakura</code>. / Sakura together with swimming pleasing is. ::: info gave a bit more literal translation just in case, \u597d\u304d is an adjectival noun. Go by Dolly tho. ::: </p> <p>But the point is that once you've put that nominalizing \u306e onto the end of it,</p> <p>when it's the \u306e that turns something into a noun, you then treat it as a noun.</p> <p>And what do you do with a noun?</p> <p>You put a logical particle onto it, don't you?</p> <p>So, this is simple logic.</p> <p>If you have any questions or comments, please put them in the Comments below</p> <p>and I will answer as usual.</p> <p>I'd like to thank my Gold Kokeshi patrons,</p> <p>and all my patrons and supporters on Patreon and everywhere.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/59-untranslatable-japanese-exists-how-to-understand-it/","title":"59.

I'm not doing anything.</p> <p>And in fact it does much less violence to the structure</p> <p>of the sentence if we translate it as</p> <p><code>The book is understandable (to me)</code>.</p> <p>This is almost what the Japanese is saying.</p> <p>The book is the subject and it's the book that's actually doing the action.</p> <p>The reason <code>The book is understandable to me</code></p> <p>is not a perfect translation is because, as you can see,</p> <p>this is not in fact an A-is-B sentence.</p> <p>So we shouldn't be saying</p> <p><code>The book is understandable (to me).</code></p> <p>What we have to say to get the Japanese right is</p> <p><code>The book does understandable (to me).</code></p> <p>And of course that makes no sense at all in English because in English <code>being understandable</code> is regarded as a state.</p> <p>But in Japanese it's regarded as an action, what we might call a <code>stative action</code>,</p> <p>a being-kind of action, like <code>being</code> itself.</p> <p>Even in English we can say that something <code>exists</code>.</p> <p>But generally speaking, English requires things</p> <p>to be jumping about doing something in order</p> <p>to say that they're taking any kind of action.</p> <p>But in Japanese the action of existing in particular states is often expressed by a verb.</p> <p>And this is important because it extends to a whole range of Japanese words, to \u3067\u304d\u308b</p> <p>and to any verb which has the potential helper attached.</p> <p>So if we say <code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b</code></p> <p></p> <p>it gets translated as <code>I can do Japanese</code> or <code>I can speak Japanese</code>, which is even stranger</p> <p>because there's no <code>speak</code> in there and what it's actually saying is that</p> <p><code>Japanese is possible (to me)</code>, but again this is an A-is-B construction</p> <p>when in fact this is really an A-does-B sentence.</p> <p>What it's saying is <code>Japanese does possible (to me)</code>.</p> <p>Now, this may seem like a bit of a quibble, but</p> <p>it's not a quibble because the particles, the structure,</p> <p>the entire framework of the sentence is different.</p> <p>And in simple sentences like this it may not be very important</p> <p>but as sentences become more complicated, this whole issue becomes more important</p> <p>because we start to run into sentences that are quite impossible to understand</p> <p>unless we recognize what their actual structure is.</p> <p>And there is a whole range of verbs that refer to what in English would be called states.</p> <p>And in these cases the English translations are always passive.</p> <p>And they have to be passive, because there really isn't a way, another way of saying them in English.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u4e71\u308c\u308b</code> -- to be scattered or disordered;</p> <p><code>\u6b20\u3051\u308b</code> -- to be chipped or damaged or insufficient;</p> <p><code>\u6620\u308b</code> -- to be reflected or projected.</p> <p></p> <p>Each of those, as you see, I've translated with the English passive</p> <p>because it's the only way to translate them into natural English.</p> <p>But they're not in fact passive in Japanese.</p> <p>These are regarded as actions done by</p> <ul> <li> <p>the thing which is disordered,</p> </li> <li> <p>the thing which is damaged,</p> </li> <li> <p>the thing which is reflected.</p> </li> </ul> <p>So if there's no alternative to translating them</p> <p>as passive, aren't we justified in doing so?</p> <p>And the answer to that is, yes of course we are absolutely justified in doing so if what we're trying to do is tell someone who doesn't know Japanese and isn't learning Japanese what is being said or, more accurately, what would be being said by an English speaker in the same circumstance.</p> <p>But if, as learners of Japanese, we don't know what the sentence is actually doing,</p> <p>we're going to get ourselves into an awful tangle.</p> <p>We're going to look at sentences and wonder what they mean and if we try to make our own sentences we just won't be able to do it because we'll be looking for passive constructions, we'll be trying to build sentences according to principles that we haven't been introduced to and don't understand.</p> <p>So the thing to understand here is that in Japanese verbs can and often do represent</p> <p>what in English can only be expressed as either states of being or passive actions.</p> <p>And then there is another group of verbs which is closely related in type to this in which</p> <p>they get translated as <code>becoming</code> a particular thing:</p> <p><code>\u6fe1\u308c\u308b</code> -- to become wet;</p> <p><code>\u6fc1\u308b</code> -- to become cloudy or muddy.</p> <p></p> <p>Again, in Japanese this isn't talked about as <code>becoming</code> anything. It's simply an action in itself.</p> <p>If we wanted to find a way of putting it in English</p> <p>we'd have to invent a word like <code>muddify</code> or <code>cloudify</code> or <code>wetiniflicate</code>,</p> <p>but in fact of course these words don't exist in English.</p> <p>And the key to understanding them in Japanese is not to try to translate them into English but to see how they're actually working in the Japanese</p> <p>and to be aware that one-for-one translations are not possible in these cases.</p> <p>And these becoming words like <code>\u6fc1\u308b</code> or <code>\u6fe1\u308c\u308b</code> can also be used in the continuous present to get us back to our passive states that we had with the other words.</p> <p>So, say, <code>\u6fc1\u3066\u3044\u308b</code>: we're saying what in English can only be translated as to <code>be cloudy</code>, but in Japanese, again, it's to <code>exist in a state of cloudiness</code>.</p> <p>So this is quite a simple and straightforward issue, but it's very important that we absorb and understand this principle or we're going to have a lot of trouble</p> <p>with a whole range of Japanese expressions..</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/6-adjectives/","title":"6. Adjectives","text":"<p>Lesson 6: Japanese <code>Adjectives</code> - the real secret that makes them easy. What schools never teach.</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we are going to talk about adjectives. Now, Japanese adjectives are not the same thing as English adjectives. As we know, Japanese sentences come in three fundamental kinds, depending on the kind of engine they have.</p> <p></p> <p>We have the \u3046-Train, verb sentences; the \u3060-Train, noun sentences; and the \u3044-Train, which is the so-called adjectival sentences. But the truth is that any one of the three kinds of engine can be used like an adjective.</p> <p></p> <p>So let's start off with the most obvious one, the one that's called <code>adjective</code> in English.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/6-adjectives/#-train-adjectives","title":"\u3044-train adjectives","text":"<p>A simple \u3044-Train sentence is <code>\u30da\u30f3\u304c\u3042\u304b\u3044</code>. As you know, <code>\u3042\u304b\u3044</code> doesn't mean <code>red</code>, it means <code>is-red</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, we can turn this black engine white and put it behind the pen. Now we have <code>\u3042\u304b\u3044\u30da\u30f3\u304c</code>.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u3042\u304b\u3044\u30da\u30f3</code> means <code>is-red pen</code> or, as we say in English, <code>red pen</code>. As you see, this isn't a full sentence in itself any more because a white engine doesn't pull the train, it just tells us more about whatever it is sitting behind.</p> <p>So <code>\u3042\u304b\u3044</code>, once it becomes a white engine, is just telling us more about the main car of the sentence, which is <code>\u30da\u30f3</code>. And if we want to make it into a full sentence, we have to have a new engine. So, let's take <code>\u3061\u3044\u3055\u3044</code>, which means <code>is-small</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3042\u304b\u3044\u30da\u30f3\u304c\u3061\u3044\u3055\u3044</code> \u2013 <code>The red pen is small</code>. (or I guess <code>is-red pen is-small</code>)</p> <p></p> <p>So that's simple enough.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/6-adjectives/#using-verbs-like-adjectives","title":"Using verbs like adjectives","text":"<p>Now let's look at verbs. Now, if you're worrying about \u306a-adjectives, as they are called, don't worry. They are nouns, and we'll get to them in a minute. Any \u3046-Engine, any verb, in any tense, can be used like an adjective.</p> <p></p> <p>So, we can say, <code>\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3058\u3087\u304c\u3046\u305f\u3063\u305f</code>. <code>\u6b4c\u3063\u305f/\u3046\u305f\u3063\u305f</code> means <code>sang</code>. The word for sing is <code>\u3046\u305f\u3046</code>, so the \u305f-form, as we know from our last lesson, is <code>\u3046\u305f\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3058\u3087\u304c\u3046\u305f\u3063\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>The girl sang</code>,</p> <p></p> <p>and if we turn that engine white and put it behind the girl, we have <code>\u3046\u305f\u3063\u305f\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3058\u3087</code> \u2013 <code>the girl who sang</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And of course, once again this isn't a sentence. But we can put in into any sentence we like, such as <code>\u3046\u305f\u3063\u305f\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3058\u3087\u304c\u306d\u3066\u3044\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>the girl who sang is sleeping</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And this is terribly important because a lot of Japanese is structured this way. We can use entire verb-sentences as adjectivals if we want to, and this happens very often.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u3044\u306c\u304c\u3058\u3057\u3087\u3092\u305f\u3079\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>the dog ate the dictionary</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>We can turn this around to <code>\u3058\u3057\u3087\u3092\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044\u306c\u304c</code> \u2013 <code>the dog who ate the dictionary</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Or we can say, <code>\u3044\u306c\u304c\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3058\u3057\u3087</code> \u2013 <code>the dictionary that was eaten by the dog</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>::: info In Japanese, this is not a passive sentence obviously. It is just a bit hard to translate into English as it would be in Japanese. As can be seen, the Japanese parts are much simpler. :::</p> <p>And then this can build into the full sentence, <code>\u3058\u3057\u3087\u3092\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044\u306c\u304c\u3084\u3093\u3061\u3083\u3060</code>. <code>\u3084\u3093\u3061\u3083</code> is a noun that means <code>naughty</code> or <code>bad</code>, so, <code>the dog who ate the dictionary is bad</code>.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/6-adjectives/#using-adjectival-nouns-as-adjectives","title":"Using adjectival-nouns as adjectives","text":"<p>This brings us to the noun-engine. If we just say <code>\u3044\u306c\u304c\u3084\u3093\u3061\u3083\u3060</code>, we have a simple noun sentence. But we can turn this engine as well into a white engine and put it behind the dog. But there is one change we have to make.</p> <p>When we turn <code>\u3060</code> or <code>\u3067\u3059</code> into a white engine, when we connect it to anything, it changes its form from <code>\u3060</code> to <code>\u306a</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So we say <code>\u3044\u306c\u304c\u3084\u3093\u3061\u3083\u3060</code>, but we say <code>\u3084\u3093\u3061\u3083\u306a\u3044\u306c</code>, which is the same as saying <code>\u3084\u3093\u3061\u3083\u3060\u3044\u306c</code> \u2013 <code>is-bad dog / the dog that is bad / the bad dog</code>.</p> <p>So we can say <code>\u3084\u3093\u3061\u3083\u306a\u3044\u306c\u304c\u306d\u3066\u3044\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>the bad dog is sleeping</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, the important thing to note here is that you can't do this with every noun. There are only some nouns that are frequently used in an adjectival way, that you can use in the way we showed here.</p> <p>These are what the textbooks call <code>\u306a-adjectives</code>, and it's a slightly confusing term, because as we see they are in fact nouns, but they are a certain class of noun.</p> <p>::: info Mark that <code>a certain class of noun</code>, they are NOT actual proper nouns. Just a subclass. They cannot be used alone like proper nouns (e.g. a subject). There are different names for them for that reason - Adjectival Nouns, \u306a-adjectives, Adjectivals, Nominal Adjectives etc\u2026 </p> <p>It is just that they mostly resemble a form similar to proper nouns and take a copula like them and so they can be considered to be (and likely are) a class of nouns, just not as proper nouns. :::</p> <p>Can we use other nouns as adjectives? Yes, we can, but we use them in a somewhat different way and they aren't engines.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/6-adjectives/#the-car","title":"The \u306e car","text":"<p>To explain this we have to introduce a new type of car for our train. And this is the \u306e car. \u306e [no] is a very simple particle because it works exactly like apostrophe-s ['s] in English.</p> <p></p> <p>So, <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306e\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9</code> means <code>Sakura's dress</code>. <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306e\u306f\u306a/\u9f3b</code> means <code>my nose</code>.  ::: info Or as shown, literally <code>Me's nose</code>. ::: Luckily, we don't have to worry about things like <code>my</code> and <code>your</code> and <code>her</code> and <code>his</code> in Japanese; we always just use <code>\u306e</code>.</p> <p>Now, because <code>\u306e</code> is the possessive particle, it can be used in another, slightly different way. At the beginning of my older videos, I always used to say, <code>\u30ab\u30ef\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u306e\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30c9\u30ea\u3067\u3059</code> \u2013 <code>(I am) KawaJapa's Cure Dolly</code>. (*\u3067\u3059 = \u3060)</p> <p>In other words, KawaJapa is the group or party or website that I belong to.</p> <p>And we can use this more widely for defining the group or class to which anything belongs. So, <code>\u3042\u304b\u3044</code> means <code>red</code> because we can turn the noun <code>\u3042\u304b</code> into the adjectival form <code>\u3042\u304b\u3044</code>. But we can't do that with all colors.</p> <p>For example, <code>\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u3044\u308d</code>. <code>\u3044\u308d/\u8272</code> means <code>color</code>, and we say <code>\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u3044\u308d</code>, that means <code>pink</code>. But that doesn't have an \u3044-form. And it doesn't count as an adjectival noun, a \u306a-adjective, as they are called in English, either.</p> <p>So what we do with it is, we use <code>\u306e</code>. <code>\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u3044\u308d\u306e\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9</code> \u2013 <code>pink dress</code>. And this means <code>dress belonging to the class of pink things</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>::: info Dolly uses Hiragana here for <code>Pink</code>. Normally it is written in Katakana, as a loan word. :::</p> <p>If we want to say <code>Oscar the Rabbit</code>, we say <code>\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u306e\u30aa\u30b9\u30ab\u30eb</code>, which literally means <code>rabbit's Oscar</code>, and what it means is <code>Oscar who belongs to the class rabbit**** </code>.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u3067\u3093\u305b\u3064</code> means <code>the legend of Zelda</code>; <code>\u3067\u3093\u305b\u3064\u306e\u305b\u3093\u3057</code> means <code>legendary warrior / warrior who belongs to the class of legendary things</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So we have four ways of forming adjectivals: the three engines plus the \u306e car.</p> <p>And using this we can make all kinds of sentences and they can become very complex, especially with verbal adjectives in which we can use whole complex sentences in an adjectival manner.</p> <p>And I'm going to do some worksheets that will help us to get used to some of those more complex sentences and I'll put them in the information section below this video lesson.</p> <p>Now, one thing you may be thinking is, <code>Since some nouns are used as adjectives with \u306a and some with \u306e, do I have to start learning lists of which ones go with \u306e and which ones go with \u306a?</code></p> <p></p> <p>And my answer to that is, I don't see any good reason to do so unless you are having to learn them for an exam.</p> <p>Why not? Well, look at it logically. If you hear someone use them with either <code>\u306e</code> or <code>\u306a</code>, you're going to know what they're saying. If you use them yourself and you get it wrong, nobody is going to have any difficulty understanding what you're saying, and it's a very small and typical foreigner's mistake, and frankly it's the least of your worries at an early stage. If you're writing, you can of course look them up very easily.</p> <p>As you use Japanese more, hear more Japanese, read more Japanese, you will pick up which ones are <code>\u306e</code> and which ones are <code>\u306a</code>. And if you're not going to use Japanese very much, well, why do you need to know?</p> <p>To me, Japanese isn't a game of learning abstract information for no particular reason. It's a language that for the most part we can learn in a natural manner, and understanding its real structure helps us very greatly to do that.</p> <p>::: info If it is a bit too much to take, I always recommend checking the comments under the video. And obviously, rereading and taking it in smaller chunks.

When it reached the bottom,</p> <p>Sakura picked it up and walked away with it.\"</p> <p>Now, you see, the first <code>it</code> is the object of my dropping it:</p> <p><code>I dropped it.</code></p> <p>The second and third <code>it</code>:</p> <p><code>It rolled down the hill... it reached the bottom</code> --</p> <p>in those two the ball is the subject.</p> <p>And then <code>Sakura picked it up</code>,</p> <p>and it's become the object again,</p> <p>the object this time of Sakura's action.</p> <p>So <code>it</code> is not tracking the subject, it's not tracking the object,</p> <p>it's tracking the topic, the thing we're talking about.</p> <p></p> <p>That's what a topic is.</p> <p>And as I said, Japanese always has a topic, even though we can't always see it.</p> <p>So, if we say <code>\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3067\u3059</code>, usually we would</p> <p>map that out as <code>zero\u304c\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3067\u3059</code> \u2013 <code>I am an American</code>, but to be completely thorough</p> <p>we would have to map it as <code>zero\u306fzero\u304c\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3067\u3059</code>,</p> <p>that is <code>I am the topic, I am the subject, and I'm an American.</code></p> <p></p> <p>We don't have to go through all that every time, but it's important to know that it exists.</p> <p>When the topic and the subject are the same, it's not so important, but as we know they often aren't.</p> <p>And in Japanese much more than in English they very often aren't.</p> <p>So, in sentences like <code>\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3060</code>, <code>\u982d\u304c\u75db\u3044</code>, <code>\u304a\u306a\u304b\u304c\u7a7a\u3044\u305f</code>, <code>\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u304c\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044</code>,</p> <p>all of these are complete logical sentences:</p> <p><code>Coffee is likeable</code>; <code>Head hurts</code>; <code>Stomach is empty</code>; <code>Crepes are eat-want-inducing</code>.</p> <p>In each case we have an A-car, we have a B-engine, we have a complete logical clause.</p> <p>But while it's logically complete, it isn't grammatically complete without understanding</p> <p>that there is also an invisible \u306f-marked topic:</p> <p></p> <p><code>zero\u306f\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3060</code>; <code>zero\u306f\u982d\u304c\u75db\u3044</code>; <code>zero\u306f\u304a\u306a\u304b\u304c\u7a7a\u3044\u305f</code>; <code>zero\u306f\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u304c\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044</code>.</p> <p><code>In relation to me, coffee is likeable/pleasing</code>;</p> <p><code>In relation to me, head hurts</code>;</p> <p><code>In relation to me, stomach is empty</code>;</p> <p><code>In relation to me, crepes are eat-want-inducing</code>.</p> <p>And while, as with the zero \u304c-marked pronoun,</p> <p>the default is <code>I</code> but it doesn't have to be <code>I</code>,</p> <p>so the \u306f-marked zero-pronoun the same applies.</p> <p>For example, if we look at a tall person go by and we say</p> <p><code>\u80cc\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3001\u306d?</code>, literally, <code>back is high, isn't it?</code></p> <p>and that's the way we say someone is tall.</p> <p>But as you see, this isn't complete without</p> <p>the \u306f-marked zero pronoun: <code>zero\u306f\u80cc\u304c\u9ad8\u3044</code> \u2013 <code>In relation to that person, back is tall</code>.</p> <p>And because Japanese has so many constructions that don't center on an ego,</p> <p>as we talked about in one of our previous videos (Lesson 9),</p> <p>so many constructions in which neither the A-car nor the B-engine are in fact the person concerned, like all the examples we've just talked about,</p> <p>it's very necessary in lots of cases that we understand that the \u306f-marked topic is there.</p> <p>And the other thing we need to understand about topic-comment structure is that</p> <p>the comment is always a complete logical clause.</p> <p></p> <p>The topic is usually a noun (it could be something else)</p> <p>but the comment is always and must always be a complete logical clause.</p> <p>This is something the textbooks don't explain,</p> <p>and it may be a good thing that they don't explain it,</p> <p>because if they did, I think we know how they'd go about it. They'd present this as some kind of strange Oriental rule that we have to memorize.</p> <p>But that's not what it is: it's a logical necessity.</p> <p>As we know, every sentence, every logical clause, must</p> <p>have an A-car and a B-engine, a subject and a predicate, and as we know from our third lesson on \u306f,</p> <p>\u306f can never mark either the A-car or the B-engine, or any other element of a logical sentence. It can only mark the non-logical topic.</p> <p>So that means that if we're going to have a sentence</p> <p>at all, both its elements have to be outside of the topic.</p> <p>We have to have a topic and we also have to have</p> <p>an A-car, we also have to have a B-engine.</p> <p>Therefore, every topic-comment sentence</p> <p>only has two elements, the topic and the comment.</p> <p>Both the elements of the logical clause have to be in the comment.</p> <p>Therefore, logically, in a topic-comment sentence the comment is always a logical clause.</p> <p>In another video I've talked, and I'm going to talk again,</p> <p>about some of the implications of what is called the choice between \u306f and \u304c;</p> <p>what it means when we mark something with \u306f, what it means when we mark it with \u304c.</p> <p></p> <p>And there are a lot of implications involved here.</p> <p>I won't go into them in this video but you can watch the other one and I'll put a card up for that.</p> <p>But the thing to remember here because we're talking about the actual structure, is that</p> <p>when people talk about the choice between \u306f and \u304c, it's confusing and somewhat misleading because it implies that \u306f and \u304c are somewhat similar, that they do a similar kind of job.</p> <p>And we know that they don't. We know that</p> <p>they're absolutely different species of particle.</p> <p>And what we know from this lesson is that</p> <p>what we're actually doing when we're making</p> <p>a choice between \u306f and \u304c is that we're choosing</p> <p>which of two elements which are always present to make visible, whether we make the \u306f visible, the \u304c visible, or neither visible.</p> <p>So we can say <code>\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3067\u3059</code>,</p> <p>we can say <code>\u79c1\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3067\u3059</code>,</p> <p>and we can say <code>\u79c1\u304c\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3067\u3059</code>.</p> <p>And each of those has a slightly different implication.</p> <p>When we're not actually choosing between \u306f and \u304c,</p> <p>what we're choosing to do is to emphasize,</p> <p>by making it visible, the topic-nature of the subject</p> <p>or the subject-nature of the topic, or neither.</p> <p>And which of those we choose to emphasize has big implications for what we're saying</p> <p>and what we're implying\u2026</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/61-%E3%81%AF-and-%E3%81%8C-the-deeper-secrets-the-yin-yang-structure-of-japanese/","title":"61. \u306f and \u304c: the Deeper Secrets!

The yin-yang structure of Japanese | Lesson 61</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we're going to talk about the subtler meanings of the \u306f- and \u304c-particles</p> <p>and the implications they can have in different uses.</p> <p>Last week (Lesson 60) we looked at the fact that topic-comment structure is fundamental to Japanese.</p> <p></p> <p>Every Japanese sentence has a topic as well as a subject,</p> <p>so that we can say that where the topic and the subject</p> <p>are not made explicit, Japanese sentences</p> <p>have both an invisible \u304c and an invisible \u306f.</p> <p>So, <code>\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u3067\u3059</code>, meaning <code>I am a Japanese person</code>,</p> <p>is strictly <code>zero\u306fzero\u304c\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u3067\u3059</code> --</p> <p><code>I am the topic, I am the subject, and I am a Japanese person.</code></p> <p></p> <p>On the whole, we don't need to worry about the invisible \u306f,</p> <p>and that's because in English and related languages</p> <p>we don't normally need to have the topic made explicit.</p> <p>We do need to have the subject repeatedly made explicit,</p> <p>so we feel a bit lost if we don't know where it is.</p> <p>And that's why we use the invisible\u304c model.</p> <p>But the important thing that we concluded in</p> <p>our last lesson was that the so-called choice</p> <p>between \u306f and \u304c, which only exists, of course,</p> <p>in sentences where the topic and the subject</p> <p>happen to be the same thing,</p> <p>and what we're doing is not really making a topic or making a subject: we are emphasizing the fact that something is either the topic or the subject.</p> <p>And this choice is important for the implication</p> <p>we're going to throw on that topic/subject.</p> <p>And in order to understand the implication, we do have to have some idea of what is the most natural way of putting a thing.</p> <p>And this is why I always say that structure is important,</p> <p>but you can't understand Japanese with structure alone.</p> <p>You have to have enough immersion to understand what sounds natural.</p> <p>And from that plus the use of structure you can understand what implications</p> <p>are being made by a particular statement.</p> <p>Now, when we treat something as a topic and mark it</p> <p>with \u306f or \u3082, this can't be new information.</p> <p>Just as in English if we say,</p> <p><code>Speaking of Melfrog Pooftoofular</code>,</p> <p>it's no good saying that if your hearer doesn't know who or what <code>Melfrog Pooftoofular</code> is.</p> <p>You have to start by introducing <code>Melfrog Pooftoofular</code> first.</p> <p>So a topic-marker can only mark old information.</p> <p>And this is important because old information is unimportant information.</p> <p>New information is what you are actually trying to convey to someone.</p> <p>This is the way language works.</p> <p>We're not supposed to be telling people things they already know. We're supposed to be adding something that they don't know, and that is the actual information content of the statement.</p> <p>So, in a certain way, \u306f works like <code>the</code> in English, only in this one respect, that it can't mark new information.</p> <p>So if we say <code>I fed the iguana</code>, unless people already know about this iguana,</p> <p>they're immediately going to say, \"What iguana? You never talked about any iguana before.</p> <p>What are you talking about, 'the iguana'?\"</p> <p>If you say <code>I fed an iguana</code>, that's all right.</p> <p>And we also need to understand that this concept of old versus new information and important versus unimportant information is closely bound up.</p> <p>So you can in fact say <code>I fed the dog</code> without anybody knowing that you even had a dog,</p> <p>because it's very normal and natural for a person to have a dog.</p> <p>They don't particularly want to stop and have that point explained anyway.</p> <p>So <code>I fed the dog</code> will be taken to mean</p> <p><code>I fed the dog that I keep at home, even though you didn't know I kept a dog at home, you do now</code>.</p> <p>If I say <code>I fed the iguana</code>, that's a conversation stopper.</p> <p>If you don't introduce the iguana first, nobody's going to just take it as read --</p> <p><code>Yes-yes, she's got an iguana at home, like most people.</code></p> <p>So you see that while we say linguistically <code>new information</code> versus <code>old information</code>,</p> <p>it's a bit subtler than that.</p> <p>It's <code>new, important, relevant information</code> versus</p> <p><code>old information or information that we can easily take as read</code>.</p> <p>And even this is quite a heavy-handed way of describing it.</p> <p>Let's take a look at how this sort of thing</p> <p>works in practice in Japanese.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u672c\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code>, this is the most normal way of saying <code>I bought a book</code>.</p> <p>As we know, the zero-pronoun defaults to <code>I</code> when the context isn't telling us that it's anything else.</p> <p>So <code>\u672c\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code> puts no particular emphasis on anything;</p> <p>it's just saying, neutrally, <code>I bought a book</code>.</p> <p>Now, in this sentence, <code>I</code> is the subject and the topic.</p> <p>If we choose to stress <code>I</code> as the topic and say <code>\u79c1\u306f\u672c\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code>,</p> <p>we're making <code>\u79c1</code> into the old information, the buying of the book into the new information, and because of this, \u306f has a distinguishing function.</p> <p>When we use \u306f, we are either establishing or changing the topic. And even establishing a topic is in most cases changing it,</p> <p>because we can assume there was some topic before.</p> <p>So we're changing the topic to <code>I</code> and saying that I bought a book.</p> <p>And we know that what \u306f does is not only change the topic to whatever it marks (in this case <code>I</code>) but it also implies that the comment on the new topic is different from the comment on the old topic.</p> <p>And if there wasn't in fact an old topic, it still implies that it's different from</p> <p>the comment on other possible topics.</p> <p>So, <code>\u79c1\u306f\u672c\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code> is essentially saying \"What I did was bought a book.</p> <p>You may have bought something else, other people may not have bought anything at all,</p> <p>but what I did was buy a book.\"</p> <p>We're stressing the fact that I bought a book as opposed to other possible topics</p> <p>who didn't buy a book.</p> <p>This means that it is implicitly the answer to a question</p> <p>which may not in fact have been asked:</p> <p><code>What did you do?</code></p> <p>The answer to <code>What did I do?</code> is <code>I bought a book</code> when you're marking <code>I</code> with \u306f.</p> <p>Now, if you say <code>\u79c1\u304c\u672c\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code>, you've changed the emphasis.</p> <p>You've reversed the emphasis.</p> <p>The old information is now the buying of the book and the new information is <code>I</code>.</p> <p>So under what circumstances do you say that?</p> <p>Well, suppose people are looking at an empty space in the bookshelf and wondering what happened, and you say <code>\u79c1\u304c\u672c\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>I'm the one who bought the book.</code></p> <p>We all know that the book's gone, we know something happened to the book,</p> <p>now I'm giving you the new information:</p> <p><code>I</code> am the one who bought the book.</p> <p>So while <code>\u79c1\u306f\u672c\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code> is implicitly the answer to the question <code>What did you do?</code>,</p> <p><code>\u79c1\u304c\u672c\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f</code> is implicitly the answer to <code>Who bought the book?</code></p> <p>It's also important to understand what is the natural, neutral way of saying something.</p> <p>We know in this case that the natural, neutral way</p> <p>of saying <code>I bought a book</code> without emphasizing</p> <p>anything is just to say <code>\u672c\u3092\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p>So if we say <code>\u79c1\u306f</code> or <code>\u79c1\u304c</code>, we're specifically making a point here.</p> <p>We're adding something to the neutral statement that I bought a book.</p> <p>Now, from this direction of the emphasis forward or backward, \u306f, and \u304c can mark particularities as opposed to generalities.</p> <p></p> <p>So, for example, if we say <code>\u82b1\u304c\u7dba\u9e97\u3060</code>,</p> <p>we're stressing the <code>\u82b1</code> as the subject and this means</p> <p><code>The flower (or these flowers) are pretty</code>.</p> <p><code>Pretty</code> is important, but the real subject is <code>these flowers</code>.</p> <p>These flowers are what is pretty, these are pretty flowers.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u82b1\u306f\u7dba\u9e97\u3060</code>, we are likely</p> <p>to be saying that flowers in general are pretty.</p> <p>We haven't singled out any flowers as the subject;</p> <p>we've made <code>flowers</code> the topic, and the important new information is prettiness.</p> <p>Flowers in themselves are not new. They're something we've known about for a long time.</p> <p>The fact that they're pretty is my comment, my assessment of them.</p> <p><code>\u82b1\u304c\u7dba\u9e97\u3060</code> \u2013 the flowers are taken to be something new.</p> <p>They're taken to be a particular subject in themselves and so we're more likely to be</p> <p>talking about particular flowers instead of flowers in general.</p> <p>Now, all the time we're talking about tendencies here, aren't we?</p> <p>There's no logical, structural reason why saying</p> <p><code>I fed the iguana</code> is any different from saying <code>I fed the dog</code>.</p> <p>It becomes different because of expectations.</p> <p>We expect someone is very likely to have a dog</p> <p>and so this is not new or important information.</p> <p>We don't expect someone to have an iguana, so this counts as new, important information and you can't slip it by with a <code>the</code> in the same way that you can the dog.</p> <p>Similarly, \u304c can mark new material as well as old material, but \u306f can't mark new material.</p> <p>\u306f can mark specific things as well as generalities but \u304c can't really mark generalities.</p> <p>So we're talking about fairly subtle shades here.</p> <p>Now, knowing the usual way of saying something, again,</p> <p>is what gives using a different strategy its emphasis.</p> <p>So, as I spoke about in an earlier video on \u306f and \u304c</p> <p>(which I would recommend seeing, because it covers some material I'm not covering here)</p> <p>we know that <code>\u96e8\u304c\u964d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b</code> means <code>it's raining</code>.</p> <p>This is the normal way to say it's raining.</p> <p>We use \u304c. We can't use nothing because we have to say what's falling,</p> <p>and we don't normally use \u306f.</p> <p>So <code>\u96e8\u304c\u964d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b</code> simply means <code>rain is falling</code>.</p> <p><code>\u96e8\u306f\u964d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b</code> is something you'd say when perhaps</p> <p>there was an expectation that it was going to snow.</p> <p></p> <p>Rain is the topic and the comment on it is that it's falling, with the implication that if the topic were different the comment would also be different,</p> <p>because we're using \u306f not \u3082, and \u306f is the exclusive topic-marker as opposed</p> <p>to \u3082, which is the inclusive topic-marker.</p> <p>Now, it's not only used for differentiation; it's also used because it throws emphasis forward. It's also used for emphasis.</p> <p>So I'm going to take an example here from one of my favorite anime, which is Aria the animation.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I don't think it has any Japanese subtitles,</p> <p>so you may have to wait a little while before you watch that.</p> <p>I know you never watch anything with English subtitles</p> <p>any more and I congratulate you for that.</p> <p>So the sentence is <code>\u304a\u307e\u3048\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u534a\u4eba\u524d\u306b\u4f11\u307f\u306f\u306a\u3044</code>.</p> <p><code>\u304a\u307e\u3048\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u534a\u4eba\u524d\u306b\u4f11\u307f\u306f\u306a\u3044</code></p> <p>And what this means is <code>For trainees like you, there are no rests</code>.</p> <p>Now, it's interesting to notice what's going on here.</p> <p>What is the topic of this sentence?</p> <p>Actually, it's <code>trainees like you</code>:</p> <p><code>\u304a\u307e\u3048\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u534a\u4eba\u524d\u306b</code> could have been</p> <p><code>\u304a\u307e\u3048\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u534a\u4eba\u524d\u306b\u306f</code> and this would made a topic out of <code>trainees like you</code>,</p> <p>and the comment on this would be the logical clause <code>\u4f11\u307f\u304c\u306a\u3044</code> -- <code>there are no rests</code>.</p> <p>However, the speaker has chosen to do something different.</p> <p>She's chosen to de-emphasize the topic by not marking it with \u306f,</p> <p>but this doesn't stop it being the topic.</p> <p>It's still the topic on which the logical clause is a comment.</p> <p>And she's made a sub-topic out of <code>\u4f11\u307f</code> -- <code>rests</code>.</p> <p>Why has she done that?</p> <p></p> <p>Because when you make something a topic, even if it's a kind of sub-topic like this,</p> <p>you're throwing the emphasis forward onto what follows it.</p> <p>You're making the thing that follows it the salient, the important information of the sentence.</p> <p>So, what it's saying here is <code>\u4f11\u307f\u306f (zero\u304c) \u306a\u3044</code> -- <code>As for rests, (they) don't exist</code>:</p> <p><code>For trainees like you, as for rests, (they) don't exist.</code></p> <p>Now, this isn't quite as cumbersome as it sounds in English</p> <p>because \u306f is a much more flexible particle</p> <p>that can be used much more easily than things like <code>as for</code> in English.</p> <p>But it's using the same essential strategy to throw</p> <p>all the emphasis of that entire sentence onto that last word, <code>\u306a\u3044</code> -- <code>they don't exist</code> --</p> <p><code>forget about rests, you're not getting any.</code></p> <p>Now, I hope this makes the topic-marking \u306f</p> <p>and the subject-marking \u304c a little bit clearer</p> <p>in their deeper and subtler implications\u2026</p> <p>::: info This may be quite a difficult thing to grasp, as always, comments under the video may perhaps help a bit.

Is this something we can understand from an English point of view? I would say yes, it is.</p> <p>We do the same thing in English, though not so much with verbs as with prepositions,</p> <p>particularly the prepositions <code>up</code> and <code>out</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>We eat things up, we make things up, we cry out, we lose out, we think up an idea, we think out an idea, etcetera etcetera. Now, Japanese doesn't have any prepositions.</p> <p>None at all. If you think it has, it's time to throw that textbook out of the window.</p> <p>What it uses in place of these English prepositions <code>up</code>, <code>out</code>, etcetera, are verbs -- helper verbs. And the difference between the Japanese helper verb and the English verb-helper preposition is first of all that there are a lot more of them and then, because of that, they're a lot more specific. If you look at the various ways in which English speakers use <code>up and </code>out<code> -- they even </code>peace out\", whatever that means -- you can see that because there are only a few of them they get used all over the place in all kinds of circumstances and there's only a marginal amount of reason to the way they're used.</p> <p>Now, because there are more helper verbs, they can be much more targeted.</p> <p>So, even though they're used widely, in a whole range of situations, we can</p> <p>generally tell what any given helper verb is doing,</p> <p>if we understand that we need a fairly wide interpretation.</p> <p>So what <code>-\u3066\u304a\u304f</code> is doing here is really what it always does.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u7a93\u3092\u958b\u3051\u3066\u304a\u304f</code>, what we're saying is \"open the window in order that the window will be open and probably that</p> <p>ventilation is going to come into the room\".</p> <p></p> <p>Open it for a purpose, put that action in place:</p> <p><code>\u304a\u304f</code>, which means <code>put in a place</code>.</p> <p>Put that action in place so that it will then\u3000 change the circumstance in the way that we want.</p> <p>In this case, airing out the room.</p> <p>And the same with the <code>\u8aac\u660e</code> here.</p> <p><code>\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3066\u304a\u304f</code> -- put the act of explaining, or the explanation, in place, so that, after that,</p> <p>each group will understand what's going on, they won't be in the dark about it any more.</p> <p>Now, we can compare this with another</p> <p>very common helper verb, which is <code>\u3057\u307e\u3046</code></p> <p>and its various variants like <code>\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f</code>, <code>\u3058\u3083\u3063\u305f</code> etc.</p> <p>We could say <code>\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046</code>,</p> <p>but that would have a completely different implication.</p> <p></p> <p>In this particular case it would probably mean something like \"I'll go ahead and explain to them, even though that's not what I'm expected to do,</p> <p>or perhaps not what people want me to do.

You can't put it in a box and carry it from Kyoto to Tokyo.</p> <p>So what's going on here?</p> <p>My Patron said that she looked it up on various Japanese learning sites and they couldn't explain it at all.</p> <p>They just said you have to learn which cases you use <code>\u3082\u306e</code> and which cases you use <code>\u3053\u3068</code>.</p> <p>This isn't the case at all. What <code>\u3082\u306e</code> really designates is a <code>thing</code>.</p> <p>And a thing is a noun, so it can be a concrete thing like an apple or a book or a universe,</p> <p>but it can also be an abstract thing like love or happiness.</p> <p>These are all nouns.</p> <p>So <code>\u611b\u306f\u3059\u3070\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3069</code> is the only way you can say it,</p> <p>because <code>ai</code> is a <code>\u3082\u306e</code>, not a <code>koto</code>.</p> <p>It's a noun. It's a thing.</p> <p>It's not a state, it's not an action, it's not a condition.</p> <p>It's a thing.</p> <p>And we need to bear this in mind as we look at some of the more extended meanings of <code>\u3082\u306e</code> and <code>\u3053\u3068</code>, as we start to see <code>\u3082\u306e</code> and <code>\u3053\u3068</code> on occasion being used as something like sentence enders.</p> <p>But before we get to that, let's look at some of the other extended uses of <code>\u3053\u3068</code>.</p> <p>Now, one of the most common ones is <code>\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b</code>.</p> <p>For example, we might say <code>\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b</code>.</p> <p>And that means <code>I have been to Japan</code>.</p> <p>And, as you see, <code>I have been to Japan</code> is a different kind of statement from <code>I went to Japan</code>.</p> <p><code>I went to Japan</code> is referring to one particular instance of going to Japan.</p> <p><code>I have been to Japan</code> is saying that in the past, perhaps on one occasion, perhaps on many occasions, going to Japan is something that I have done. In Japanese what we're literally saying is <code>The activity, the fact, of my having been to Japan in the past exists.</code></p> <p>Now, I had an Italian Patron at one time who took me up on my early lesson on the Japanese tenses.</p> <p>I said that Japanese has only three tenses.</p> <p>And that's correct: Japanese has only three tenses.</p> <p>And my Italian friend asked me \"So how would I say something like</p> <p>'I have been to Japan' as opposed to 'I went to Japan'?\"</p> <p>And I explained how that is. And he said <code>Well, in that case, Japanese doesn't just have three tenses. It's just like Italian or French or other European languages...</code></p> <p>It has perfective tenses and pluperfect and all these complicated things that European languages have.</p> <p>And therefore I should be teaching it that way.</p> <p>I should be teaching the Japanese past and present and future and pluperfect and perfective</p> <p>and all that sort of thing.</p> <p>But that is a perfect example of what's wrong with Western Japanese teaching.</p> <p>It would be bundling Japanese, categorizing Japanese as if it were a European language gone wrong.</p> <p>Of course any language of any sophistication needs to be able to express just about any kind of time relation.</p> <p>But it doesn't do it in the way that European languages do it.</p> <p>It doesn't do it by means of conjugating verbs.</p> <p>In fact, as I've said before, Japanese doesn't conjugate verbs at all, even in cases that look a bit more like it to Western eyes.</p> <p></p> <p>It uses an entirely different kind of strategy.</p> <p>It says <code>The fact of my having been to Japan exists</code>.</p> <p>Now, if we go from <code>\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b</code> to the present tense,</p> <p><code>\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b</code>, if instead of saying <code>\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c \u3042\u308b</code>, we say <code>\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u884c\u304f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b</code>,</p> <p>we're now saying <code>The fact of my going to Japan exists</code>.</p> <p>In other words, we're saying <code>I sometimes go to Japan / going to Japan is a fact that exists</code>.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u3069\u3093\u306a\u4eba\u306b\u3082\u5931\u6557\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b</code>, we're saying <code>everybody sometimes makes mistakes / whatever kind of person it may be, the fact of making mistakes exists</code>.</p> <p>Now, if you're going to start calling these things tenses,</p> <p>that would have to be the past-present-and-future-occasionally-happening tense,</p> <p>which is nonsense, but then so's all the rest of it.</p> <p></p> <p>It's simply the Japanese strategy for saying that a certain category of event sometimes happens\u2013the fact of its happening exists.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u3082\u306e</code> is sometimes used in ways that really do seem like a sentence-ender.</p> <p>And the first way in which this happens is when we add <code>mono \u3060</code> to a complete logical clause.</p> <p>And what this means is that the logical clause we're talking about, as a generalization, is a reality\u2013it's a <code>\u3082\u306e</code>, it's a thing, it's something we have to contend with, it's something we have to accept.</p> <p></p> <p>And this is why we're using <code>\u3082\u306e</code> here and not <code>\u3053\u3068</code>.</p> <p>When we say <code>\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b</code>, we're literally talking about a <code>\u3053\u3068</code>, a state of affairs, a fact that happens, but here we're consolidating what we're talking about into a <code>thing</code>.</p> <p>It's not literally a thing, it's not literally something you could hold in your hand,</p> <p>but we are using the hyperbole of saying that it is.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u51ac\u306f\u5bd2\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3060</code>, what we're saying is \"winter is cold, and that's just a thing,</p> <p>that's a thing, you have to come to terms with it\".</p> <p>Someone says <code>Ooh, it's cold</code> and you say <code>\u51ac\u306f\u5bd2\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3060</code> --</p> <p><code>winter IS cold / winter's a cold thing</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, we can actually parse it out in that way.</p> <p>We can make it <code>\u51ac\u306f\u5bd2\u3044</code> is a complete sentence but we could also be saying</p> <p><code>\u51ac\u306f\u5bd2\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3060</code> - <code>winter is a cold thing</code>, and this would be a complete logical sentence.</p> <p>Whether it's intended in that way or not is not always possible to tell,</p> <p>and it doesn't tend to matter because the meaning is much the same either way.</p> <p>But there are sentences when it can't possibly be read as simply grammatical.</p> <p>So, for example, we may say <code>\u5e0c\u671b\u306e\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306b\u306f\u5fc5\u305a\u8a66\u7df4\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3060</code>,</p> <p>and what we're saying there is</p> <p><code>Where there's hope, there's always a test</code>, a test here meaning something we have to overcome, something we have to do in order to attain that hope.</p> <p>Now, there's no way of tying this up logically. We simply have the complete logical sentence</p> <p><code>\u5e0c\u671b\u306e\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306b\u306f\u5fc5\u305a\u8a66\u7df4\u304c\u3042\u308b</code> and then we're adding to the end of it, as a kind of sentence-ender, <code>\u3082\u306e\u3060</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>It doesn't make logical sense, but what you're doing is making that statement and then emphasizing it and also putting a particular kind of stress on it by saying <code>\u3082\u306e\u3060</code> \u2013 <code>that's just how it is, it's a thing, that's something we have to understand, that's something we have to get used to, it's something that doesn't change, it's something that's inevitable</code>: <code>\u3082\u306e\u3060</code> \u2013 <code>it's a thing</code>.</p> <p>Now, interestingly, that's when we have <code>\u3082\u306e\u3060</code> in the present; when we put it in the past it has a different implication.</p> <p>And again, this isn't some strange rule we have to learn.</p> <p>Just as with <code>\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b</code> versus <code>\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b</code>, there are perfectly good reasons why it has to be like that. The <code>\u3082\u306e\u3060</code> we've just discussed has to be in the present tense</p> <p>because we're talking about generalization, and the present tense, as we know, isn't really a present tense.</p> <p>It covers the present and the future, and it can, even though it's called the non-past tense</p> <p>-- it's really the indefinite tense \u2013 it can cover the past as well so long as it's also covering the present and the future. So it's a generalization tense in this case. But when we say it in the past it has a different meaning.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u3053\u308d\u306b\u306f\u3001\u3088\u304f\u3053\u3061\u3089\u306b\u6765\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3060</code>, what we're saying is <code>When I was a child I often used to come to this place.</code></p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/64-things-get-strange-%E3%82%82%E3%81%AE-and-%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8-advanced-secrets-%E3%82%82%E3%81%AE%E3%81%A0-%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8C%E3%81%82%E3%82%8B-%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8-as-sentence-ender/#here-is-referring-to-something-in-the-past","title":"<code>\u3082\u306e\u3060</code> here is referring to something in the past.","text":"<p>And what it's saying is that in the past it was a thing.

going to talk about coming and going in Japanese.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u884c\u304f</code> and <code>\u6765\u308b</code> are two of the first words we learn when we start learning Japanese,</p> <p>and we learn that they mean <code>come</code> and <code>go</code>, and broadly they do.</p> <p>But as we become more advanced we understand that it isn't quite that simple.</p> <p>They have many metaphorical and more subtle meanings,</p> <p>but even the physical meaning doesn't correspond exactly to English <code>come</code> and <code>go</code>.</p> <p>Essentially, <code>iku</code> means <code>go from where the speaker is to somewhere else</code>,</p> <p>and <code>kuru</code> means <code>come from somewhere else to where the speaker is</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Isn't that just the same as English <code>come</code> and <code>go</code>?</p> <p>Well, not quite.</p> <p>For example, we can say to someone on the phone <code>Shall I come over to see you?</code></p> <p>or you might say <code>Will you come to me, or shall I come to you?</code></p> <p></p> <p>And in Japanese that's quite impossible, because you can't <code>come</code> to a place where you aren't.</p> <p><code>Coming</code> means coming from somewhere where the speaker is not</p> <p>to the place where the speaker is.</p> <p>So you can't say to someone on the telephone <code>Shall I come to you?</code> with <code>\u6765\u308b</code>.</p> <p>You can only say <code>Shall I go to you?</code> with <code>\u884c\u304f</code>.</p> <p><code>Shall I go to you?</code> would sound strange in English,</p> <p>so we see that <code>\u6765\u308b</code> and <code>\u884c\u304f</code> aren't exactly interchangeable with English <code>come</code> and <code>go</code>.</p> <p><code>\u6765\u308b</code> can only ever mean <code>move from where the speaker isn't to where the speaker is</code>.</p> <p><code>\u884c\u304f</code> is not quite so strict.</p> <p></p> <p>We can talk about someone <code>\u884c\u304f</code>-ing from A to B when we are actually at C,</p> <p>but <code>\u6765\u308b</code> must always mean movement toward C, the place where we are.</p> <p>And this is important to understand as we get into the more metaphorical meanings of <code>\u6765\u308b</code> and <code>\u884c\u304f</code>.</p> <p>We've talked about some of the extended meanings in an earlier lesson but still physical ones,</p> <p>especially those which involve connecting <code>\u6765\u308b</code> or <code>\u884c\u304f</code> to the te-form of a verb.</p> <p>So <code>\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b</code> means <code>bring (to the place where I am)</code>;</p> <p><code>\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f</code> means <code>take (from the place where I am)</code>.</p> <p>But <code>the place where I am</code> can actually be a time or it can actually be a mental state of identification.</p> <p></p> <p>So we get more advanced meanings which are all based on the fundamental physical metaphor</p> <p>of coming to the place where one is, going from the place where one is, or going from</p> <p>or going one place to another (but not coming from one place to another because that isn't possible).</p> <p>So, a very simple example is we may say <code>\u96e8\u304c\u964d\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f</code> --</p> <p>and we have almost an equivalent English expression: we might say <code>It came on to rain</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And the metaphor here is a time metaphor.</p> <p>Rain came towards us in time, from a time when it wasn't there</p> <p>to the time where we are, when the rain is there.</p> <p></p> <p>If we say <code>\u3060\u3093\u3060\u3093\u96e8\u304c\u964d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f</code>, we're saying <code>It's getting rainier and rainier</code></p> <p>and we're projecting into the future.</p> <p><code>\u3044\u304f</code> is moving from where we are into the future.</p> <p>Now, since time, at least apparently, moves forward,</p> <p>we can only use <code>\u3044\u304f</code> in the sense of moving forward in time,</p> <p>away from us, away from the point where we are, not moving backward in time</p> <p>away from the point where we are, because that isn't currently possible.</p> <p>So, <code>\u96e8\u304c\u964d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f</code> in this case implies that it has become rainy (<code>\u964d\u3063\u3066\u6765\u305f</code>) and</p> <p>that it's increasingly going to do so in the future.</p> <p>Now, we can also use <code>\u304f\u308b</code> and <code>\u3044\u304f</code> in subtler ways still, concerned not with space or time</p> <p>but with subjectivity, with our mental state.</p> <p>So, a very common expression is <code>\u5206\u304b\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b</code>, which in English might be rendered as</p> <p><code>come to understand</code>, but this of course would be wrong.</p> <p>Let's take an example of why.</p> <p>We might say <code>\u52c9\u5f37\u3059\u308c\u3070\u3001\u3060\u3093\u3060\u3093\u6570\u5b66\u304c\u5206\u304b\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b</code></p> <p>And that would be translated normally as <code>if you study, you will come to understand mathematics</code>.</p> <p>And as you can see, if you've been paying attention, there's a contradiction here.</p> <p>You can't come to a place where you aren't yet in Japanese.</p> <p>You can't use <code>\u304f\u308b</code> to speak about</p> <p>coming to somewhere that you aren't at this stage but will be in the future.</p> <p>It would have to be <code>\u3044\u304f</code>, wouldn't it?</p> <p>So why is <code>\u304f\u308b</code> used here?</p> <p>Well, if you've followed this course you probably know the answer already.</p> <p><code>\u5206\u304b\u308b</code> does not mean <code>understand</code>.</p> <p>It means <code>be understandable / be clear</code> or literally what it actually means is <code>do understandable</code>.</p> <p>So what we're in fact saying is that if you study, math will come to be understandable to you.</p> <p></p> <p>In other words, math will come from being far from you to being nearer to you and being understandable.</p> <p>So we're using this in a subjective sense.</p> <p>And this is an important thing to understand, and it's important to understand</p> <p>that <code>\u304f\u308b</code> and <code>\u3044\u304f</code> can represent movement in time, toward one or away from one,</p> <p>movement in space, toward one or away from one,</p> <p>movement in subjectivity, towards one's mental condition or state or away from it,</p> <p>but also <code>iku</code> can represent objectivity versus <code>kuru</code> representing subjectivity.</p> <p>And the reason for this is something we've already covered,</p> <p>which is that <code>iku</code> can mean moving from A to B while we are at C.</p> <p>Therefore, <code>iku</code> can represent a movement from one place to another</p> <p>that doesn't involve us, physically, temporally, or mentally or emotionally.</p> <p>So, if we say <code>samuku natte kita</code></p> <p>we're saying <code>it became cold</code>, and adding that <code>kita</code> (<code>kuru</code>) is relating it to us:</p> <p><code>It became cold (coming toward me or us).</code></p> <p>So what we're saying is not just that it became cold,</p> <p>but implying that it affects me or us subjectively: <code>Samuku natte kita</code>.</p> <p>By contrast, <code>samuku natte itta</code> is more objective.</p> <p>It doesn't involve us.

It tells us about the present,</p> <p>so we can say that it is in fact a way of saying <code>now</code>,</p> <p>but <code>now</code> in a particular relation to the past and the future.</p> <p></p> <p>What is that relation?</p> <p>Well, as you see, we have two things.</p> <p>We have the section of time in which <code>now</code> lies</p> <p>and we have a transition point.</p> <p>Since it's a section of time, it can't go on forever,</p> <p>so there's a transition point at which it changes to</p> <p>another section of time with other qualities</p> <p>that is expected in the future</p> <p>or at least considered as a possibility in the future.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u307e\u3060</code> gives us two contrasts.</p> <p>The section of time is contrasted with the future when it will or may change, but</p> <p>the present moment is contrasted with the past when it might have been expected to change.</p> <p></p> <p>So what this means in English is essentially <code>still</code>.</p> <p>And this may seem a bit abstract, but</p> <p>I think we'll understand it clearly enough when we see how it works.</p> <p>So, if we say <code>\u5bbf\u984c\u306f\u307e\u3060\u3057\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code>,</p> <p>we're saying <code>I haven't done my homework yet</code></p> <p>or <code>I still haven't done my homework.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, as you see, this means that we are in a section of time where I haven't done my homework.</p> <p>This stretches back into the past and is contrasted</p> <p>with a period in the future where I will have done my homework.</p> <p>But the present time is being contrasted</p> <p>with a time in the past where I might have or should have done my homework.</p> <p></p> <p>That's why we say <code>\u307e\u3060</code> and that's why in English we would say <code>still</code> or <code>haven't yet</code>.</p> <p>In other words, there's a time in the past where it might have been expected to happen, but it hasn't.</p> <p>So it's still in a state which won't change until the future.</p> <p>And this is what we mean by terms like <code>still</code> and <code>yet</code> in English.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u307e\u3060\u82e5\u3044</code>, we're saying <code>Sakura is still young.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now again, what we're saying is that the present time is situated in a period where Sakura is young, that period stretches back into the past and is expected to change at some time in the future.</p> <p>She won't be young forever, she'll get older.</p> <p>So we can see that the time period while Sakura is young is contrasted</p> <p>with the future when she will get older.</p> <p>But the present moment is being contrasted with the past.</p> <p></p> <p>That's why we say <code>\u307e\u3060</code> or why in English we would say <code>still</code>.</p> <p>What we're saying is <code>She hasn't stopped being young yet</code>.</p> <p>As opposed to the possibility that she stopped being young in the past,</p> <p>she hasn't stopped being young in the past -- she's still young now,</p> <p>even though she won't be young in the future.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u307e\u3060\u5927\u4eba\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044</code>,</p> <p>we're saying <code>Sakura is not yet grown-up</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So now we're using the negative, and that's why <code>\u307e\u3060</code> can mean <code>still</code> or <code>not yet</code>.</p> <p>It just depends, at least in this case, on the fact that it's being used with a negative.</p> <p>So, if we say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u307e\u3060\u5927\u4eba\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044</code>,</p> <p>we're saying that at the present period Sakura isn't grown-up.</p> <p>Even though you might have thought she'd grown up a little while ago, she hasn't.</p> <p>But of course she will grow up in the future.</p> <p>As you can see, the reason why it gets translated both as <code>still</code> and <code>not yet</code></p> <p>is because Japanese puts things a little bit differently from English.</p> <p>In English we say <code>Sakura is not yet grown-up</code>.</p> <p>But in Japanese what we actually say is <code>Sakura is still not grown up</code>.</p> <p>However, for <code>\u307e\u3060</code> to mean <code>not yet</code> we don't have to have an explicit negative.</p> <p>For example, if someone says to you</p> <p><code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306f\u4e0a\u624b\u3044\u306d</code> -- <code>Your Japanese is very good, isn't it?</code></p> <p>Well, Japanese people tend to say that even if you can stagger out <code>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f</code>.</p> <p>And even if your Japanese really is very good,</p> <p>you'll probably reply

time period where my Japanese isn't good.</p> <p>The change didn't take place in the past, as you are saying;</p> <p>it will have to take place in the future.</p> <p>And just a little cultural note In the West it can sometimes be considered a bit rude to contradict someone who's said something nice to you,</p> <p>but in Japanese we do that all the time.</p> <p>It's considered a bit arrogant not to.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/67-%E3%82%82%E3%81%86-and-%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A0-the-time-relations-that-make-sense-of-them/#_2","title":"\u3082\u3046","text":"<p>Now, let's move on to

the opposite of <code>\u307e\u3060</code>.</p> <p>The best translation for it in English is that it means <code>already</code>.</p> <p>What it means is that we are now in a time segment stretching forward into the future.</p> <p>So, just the other way around from <code>\u307e\u3060</code>.</p> <p>The time segment is compared to the past when the current conditions didn't prevail</p> <p>and now

think;</p> <p>It's already happened in the past.</p> <p></p> <p>So why is it sometimes translated as having different meanings from <code>already</code>, such as <code>now</code>?</p> <p>Well, as we've seen, both <code>\u307e\u3060</code> (<code>still</code>) and <code>\u3082\u3046</code> (<code>already</code>) are in fact species of <code>now</code>.</p> <p>We're talking about now.</p> <p>We're just making different contrasts with the past and the future when we talk about now.</p> <p></p> <p>So, of course, <code>\u3082\u3046</code> does mean <code>now</code>, just as <code>already</code> does.</p> <p>But because words in different languages very rarely</p> <p>occupy exactly the same stretch of the meaning spectrum,</p> <p>sometimes we use <code>\u3082\u3046</code> in places where we would use <code>now</code> in English.</p> <p></p> <p>And because J-E dictionaries are Anglocentric</p> <p>they will try to translate <code>\u3082\u3046</code> as meaning <code>now</code> in those cases.</p> <p>So, for example, if you've hurt yourself and you're getting up and somebody says <code>\u5927\u4e08\u592b?</code></p> <p>and you reply <code>\u3082\u3046\u5927\u4e08\u592b</code>, how you would translate this into English is usually <code>I'm all right now</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>In English you wouldn't usually say <code>I'm already all right</code>.</p> <p>Now, in Japanese you could also say <code>\u4eca\u5927\u4e08\u592b</code>, which also means <code>I'm all right now</code>,</p> <p>but when you say <code>\u3082\u3046\u5927\u4e08\u592b</code> you're specifically adding the nuance that,</p> <p>while you weren't all right before, you are now,</p> <p>as opposed to at some time in the near future, all right.</p> <p>In other words, you don't need any more time to recover, you're okay.</p> <p>In English, we don't use <code>already</code> for that.</p> <p>Logically we could, but in practice we

Well, as we've seen, <code>\u3082\u3046</code> tells us about a time relation,</p> <p>it's a time-related word, and it means <code>already</code>.</p> <p>And also the dictionaries tell us that it means <code>soon</code>.</p> <p>Why do they say that it means <code>soon</code>?</p> <p>Well, it doesn't mean soon on its own, but it means <code>soon</code> in certain combinations.</p> <p>So, for example, if we say <code>\u3082\u3046\u3059\u3050</code>, which means <code>soon</code>, what we're really saying is:</p> <p><code>\u3059\u3050</code> means <code>soon</code> and <code>\u3082\u3046</code> means <code>already</code>, so that <code>\u3082\u3046</code> is emphasizing the <code>soon</code>:</p> <p>it's already soon, it's not going to be soon at some point in the future, it's soon right now.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, we can also say <code>\u3082\u3046\u5c11\u3057</code>.</p> <p>For example, if some people are walking somewhere and they've been walking for a long time</p> <p>and they're getting tired, someone might say <code>\u3082\u3046\u5c11\u3057!</code></p> <p>which means <code>just a little more / just a little extra</code>.</p> <p>And it could mean <code>just a little more effort</code>, but it can also mean <code>just a little more time</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So, you see, <code>\u3082\u3046\u3059\u3050</code> and <code>\u3082\u3046\u5c11\u3057</code>, even though they're different words <code>\u3082\u3046</code>,</p> <p>under some circumstances have a very similar meaning.</p> <p>And the other <code>\u3082\u3046</code>, the additive <code>\u3082\u3046</code>, also is often used to express time relation.</p> <p>So if we say <code>\u3082\u3046\u4e00\u5ea6</code>, we're saying <code>one more time</code>.</p> <p>Now obviously this means very much the same as it means when we say <code>\u3082\u3046\u4e00\u3064</code>,</p> <p>which means <code>one more thing</code> -- one more candy, one more anything.</p> <p>But it also is very often used with <code>\u4e00\u5ea6</code>: one more time.</p> <p><code>\u3082\u3046\u4e8c\u5ea6\u6765\u306a\u3044</code> means <code>I'll never come again</code>, literally <code>I won't come for another second time</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So we can see that the two <code>\u3082\u3046</code>s tread fairly closely toward the same territory.</p> <p>They can both be used for time relations and in a few contexts,</p> <p>like <code>\u3082\u3046\u5c11\u3057</code> and <code>\u3082\u3046\u3059\u3050</code>, the meaning is almost identical.</p> <p>But once we understand the two and how they work,</p> <p>I don't think there's going to be any more room for confusion\u2026</p> <p></p> <p>::: info Will add this here:*  :::</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/68-japanese-underlying-logic-%E3%82%8F%E3%81%91-%E3%81%9D%E3%81%86%E3%81%84%E3%81%86%E3%82%8F%E3%81%91-%E3%82%8F%E3%81%91%E3%81%8C%E5%88%86%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84-%E3%82%8F%E3%81%91%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84/","title":"68.

(check Lesson 59)</p> <p></p> <p>And that's what <code>\u308f\u3051/\u8a33</code> means here.</p> <p>Now I know some of you may be thinking <code>but it's a different kanji</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Well, that's true. We usually associate <code>\u5206\u304b\u308b</code> with this kanji,</p> <p>but in fact you can write the word <code>\u5206\u304b\u308b</code> with three different possible kanji</p> <p>and they all have slightly different implications -- \u5206\u304b\u308b, \u89e3\u308b, \u5224\u308b</p> <p>and I've written an article (it is a video actually) about that if you're interested,</p> <p>so I'll put a link in the information section below (what is linked is a video).</p> <p>The point is that <code>\u308f\u3051 / \u5206\u304b\u308b</code> is not tied to any one kanji.</p> <p>It's a fundamental Japanese word that goes back further than the kanji used to represent it,</p> <p>and the fundamental idea in all these cases is the same:</p> <p>the idea of separation, division, analysis, breakdown.</p> <p>So, what actually is a <code>\u308f\u3051/\u8a33</code>?</p> <p>Let's take the most prominent English definitions, which are: cause, reason,</p> <p>and conclusion based on something we've seen or heard.</p> <p>Now, let's note that cause, reason, and conclusion generally speaking refer to the same thing.</p> <p>The main difference is whether the process is going backward or whether the process is going forward.</p> <p>Let's take an example.</p> <p>If I say <code>Sakura was out in the rain, and therefore she's wet</code>,</p> <p>we are taking two known facts and stating the causal, the reasoning, connection between the two.</p> <p></p> <p>If I say <code>Sakura is wet and therefore I reason that she was out in the rain</code>,</p> <p>we're taking exactly the same piece of reason, the same causality, and working in the other direction.</p> <p></p> <p>We're working from one known fact to another unknown fact that we use the reasoning to arrive at.</p> <p>But that piece of reasoning, that causal link, that fundamental underlying reasonality,</p> <p>is the same in both statements.</p> <p>In one case we're working it forward, in the other case we're working it backward,</p> <p>but that fundamental underlying causal logical reasonality, to coin a phrase, is the same.</p> <p>And I coined the phrase <code>reasonality</code> because there isn't really a word for this in English.</p> <p>But in Japanese there is, and the word is <code>\u308f\u3051/\u8a33</code>.</p> <p>So <code>\u308f\u3051</code>, as we see, expresses a cause, a reason,</p> <p>and a conclusion or a logical judgement -- all of those things.</p> <p>What it really expresses is the underlying causality or reasonality,</p> <p>and when the dictionaries say that it also expresses a circumstance or situation</p> <p>or something like that, in fact it doesn't really do that,</p> <p>but what it does is express the underlying reasonality of a circumstance or a situation.</p> <p>And once we understand that, we can start to understand the different ways in which <code>\u308f\u3051</code> is used.

/ What's this?\"</p> <p><code>\u306a\u3093\u3068\u3042\u306e\u5148\u8f29\u304c\u90e8\u5c4b\u3067\u6bba\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u3060</code> --</p> <p><code>That senpai, in that apartment, received the action of being killed.</code></p> <p></p> <p>And this is the receptive, isn't it?</p> <p>She received the action <code>being killed</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u3060</code> :</p> <p><code>\u3068\u3044\u3046</code> -- that's what she was told, that's what was said;</p> <p><code>\u306e\u3060</code> -- now, we've talked about these <code>\u3093\u3060 / \u306e\u3060</code> endings in another video.</p> <p>So this is really saying, <code>It was that senpai had, in that room, received the action of being killed.</code></p> <p>That's what it was; that was what was going on.</p> <p>When she asked about the situation, it was that the senpai had been killed in that room.</p> <p><code>\u90e8\u5c4b\u306f\u8352\u3089\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a</code></p> <p></p> <p><code>\u8352\u3089\u3059</code> is <code>storm or violate or mess up</code>.</p> <p>So, the room received the action of being messed up or violated.</p> <p>And the helper receptive verb is in \u3066-form and followed by <code>\u304a\u308a</code>.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u5c45\u308b / \u304a\u308b</code> -- as we talked about in a previous episode in this series,</p> <p><code>\u5c45\u308b / \u304a\u308b</code> is a literary, slightly old-fashioned way of saying <code>\u5c45\u308b / \u3044\u308b</code>.</p> <p>So <code>\u8352\u3089\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308b</code> is the same as <code>\u8352\u3089\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b</code>:</p> <p><code>was in a state of having received being violated or messed up</code>.</p> <p>And then that <code>\u304a\u308b</code> is put into its \u3044-stem, <code>\u304a\u308a</code>,</p> <p>which again, as we discussed before, is a slightly more</p> <p>literary way of joining two clauses in a compound sentence.</p> <p>So this joins this clause to the next clause, which gives a conjecture about the situation:</p> <p><code>The room was in a state of having received being messed up or violated, and...</code></p> <p><code>\u7269\u53d6\u308a\u306e\u72af\u884c\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046</code> :</p> <p><code>\u7269\u53d6\u308a</code> is <code>\u3082\u306e/\u7269</code> (thing) + <code>\u53d6\u308b</code> (take),</p> <p>so <code>\u7269\u53d6\u308b</code> -- <code>take thing</code>;</p> <p><code>\u7269\u53d6\u308a</code> -- the noun of taking things, so <code>\u7269\u53d6\u308a</code> here is <code>theft</code>;</p> <p><code>\u72af\u884c</code> is a <code>criminal act</code>, a <code>criminal going</code>, literally, but a criminal act. So this was perhaps or probably a crime of theft, a burglary...</p> <p><code>\u3068\u3044\u3046</code> -- <code>was said</code>. And who said it?</p> <p>Well, presumably the police.</p> <p>Now, the next part comes in quotation marks,</p> <p>those square Japanese quotation marks,</p> <p>and this is something she's thinking to herself.</p> <p>And we're going to see there are a number of clauses</p> <p>joined together here, and then they'll all end with -\u305f\u3089</p> <p>before we pass on to the comment about them.</p> <p></p> <p>So all these clauses that culminate in the -\u305f\u3089 ending</p> <p>are if-statements, conditional if-statements.</p> <p>We've talked about the conditional -\u305f\u3089, haven't we? (Lesson 32, but also check 30 &amp; 31)</p> <p>So, <code>\u3042\u306e\u6642</code> -- <code>at that time</code> --</p> <p>\u300c\u96fb\u6c17\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u3066\u5148\u8f29\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3057\u3066\u300d --</p> <p><code>if I had put on the light</code> \u2013</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u304d\u3061\u3093\u3068/\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068\u6238\u7de0\u308a\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3063\u3066</code>.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068</code> means <code>properly or correctly</code>; ::: info In the video/picture, Dolly instead gives \u304d\u3061\u3093\u3068 instead of \u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068. But in basic terms, they seem to mean the same thing - along the lines of <code>properly</code>, so it should not be a big deal. There probably is some difference, but should not be detrimental here\u2026 :::</p> <p><code>\u6238\u7de0\u308a</code> -- <code>\u6238</code> is <code>door</code>, <code>\u7de0\u307e\u308b</code> is <code>closing</code>,</p> <p>so <code>\u6238\u7de0\u308a</code> is <code>door-closing</code>.</p> <p>And then <code>\u3092\u3059\u308b</code>: you could just say</p> <p><code>\u6238\u7de0\u308a\u3092\u3059\u308b</code> -- <code>do closing the door</code> -- but here it's saying</p> <p><code>\u6238\u7de0\u308a\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3063\u3066\u6ce8\u610f\u3092\u3057\u305f\u3089</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3088\u3046\u306b</code> in this case means <code>making (something) become like (something)</code>.</p> <p>So what it's really saying is <code>made it so that the door was properly closed</code>.</p> <p>And then that <code>\u3063\u3066</code> is a shortening of <code>\u3068\u3044\u3046</code> (we've talked about that). - Lesson 18</p> <p>So <code>\u3068\u3044\u3046</code> meaning in this case <code>that kind of</code>;</p> <p><code>\u6ce8\u610f\u3092\u3057\u3066</code> -- <code>\u6ce8\u610f</code> is <code>care or caution</code> --</p> <p>you often see signs in Japan <code>\u6ce8\u610f\u3092\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044</code> \u2013 <code>take care please / act cautiously</code>.</p> <p>If she had in this way acted cautiously by turning on the lights, waking Senpai,</p> <p>making sure that the door was properly closed --</p> <p>and then this all ends with the -\u305f\u3089.</p> <p>If she'd done this...</p> <p><code>\u3053\u3093\u306a\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u306b</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, <code>\u3053\u3093\u306a\u3053\u3068</code> is <code>a state of affairs like this / this state of affairs</code> ;</p> <p><code>\u306b\u306a\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u306b</code> :</p> <p>now, as we see, this is a logical clause</p> <p>and it needs a subject, it needs a \u304c-marked A-car.</p> <p>So what is it? Well, it's a zero car, isn't it?</p> <p><code>(Zero\u304c) \u3053\u3093\u306a\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f</code> --</p> <p><code>It would not have become a thing like this.</code></p> <p>Now, what does that mean?</p> <p>I think we can see a very close English analogy to this.</p> <p>In English we would probably say, <code>it wouldn't have come to this.</code></p> <p>What she's saying is, <code>it wouldn't have become this kind of situation.</code></p> <p>So it's very much the same kind of expression strategy.</p> <p>If she'd done all those things: if she'd made sure everything was safe and proper in the house,</p> <p>even at the risk of disturbing a drunken senpai, this terrible thing wouldn't have happened.</p> <p>\u2014</p> <p><code>\u5f7c\u5973\u304c\u81ea\u8cac\u306e\u5ff5\u3067\u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u306b\u306a\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089.</code></p> <p></p> <p><code>\u81ea\u8cac</code> is <code>self-blame / self-reproach</code> --</p> <p><code>\u8cac</code> here, this kanji is the same as the kanji</p> <p>for <code>\u8cac\u3081\u308b</code> -- <code>criticize or blame</code> -- and the <code>ji</code> is <code>self</code>,</p> <p>so <code>\u81ea\u8cac... \u3067\u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u306a\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089</code> --</p> <p><code>-\u306a\u304c\u3089</code>, as I think we know, is a helper word,</p> <p>meaning doing the verb it's attached to while doing something else.</p> <p>Now, what she's doing here is becoming full of</p> <p><code>\u81ea\u8cac\u306e\u5ff5</code> -- <code>thoughts (or feelings) of self blame</code>.</p> <p>So, while becoming full of feelings of self-blame,</p> <p><code>\u6628\u65e5\u305d\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u306b\u3044\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u8b66\u5b98\u306b\u8a71\u3059\u3068</code> \u2013</p> <p></p> <p>Now, <code>\u3068</code> is giving us an if/when statement, but we'll just deal with this to start with.</p> <p><code>\u6628\u65e5\u305d\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u306b\u3044\u305f\u3053\u3068</code> means</p> <p><code>the fact that she was in the room yesterday</code>.</p> <p>Now, we know she's talking about a person (or an animal) here because it's <code>\u3044\u305f</code>,</p> <p>so the only thing it can be is herself, the fact that she was in the room.</p> <p>Had it been <code>\u6628\u65e5\u305d\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u306b\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068</code>, it might be</p> <p>saying <code>the thing that took place in the room yesterday</code>.</p> <p>Well, we know it can't be that because it's <code>\u3044\u305f</code> not <code>\u3042\u3063\u305f</code>.</p> <p>So, we're talking about a person; we're talking about her.</p> <p><code>\u6628\u65e5\u305d\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u306b\u3044\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u8b66\u5b98\u306b\u8a71\u3059</code></p> <p>and then <code>\u3068</code>, which is our if/when statement.</p> <p>So, when she told the police the fact that she'd been in the room yesterday...</p> <p><code>\u90e8\u5c4b\u306e\u5965\u304b\u3089\u5211\u4e8b\u304c\u73fe\u308c\u3066...</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now again, it's ending in the \u3066-form; it's going to lead on to something else.</p> <p>So it's a complex sentence, but it's not really difficult</p> <p>because it's made up of clear logical clauses</p> <p>building one on another into a larger whole.</p> <p>So, <code>\u90e8\u5c4b\u306e\u5965\u304b\u3089\u5211\u4e8b\u304c\u73fe\u308c\u3066</code>:</p> <p>from the interior of the room, from inside the room</p> <p>-- <code>\u5965</code>, <code>the inside /the interior</code> --</p> <p><code>\u5211\u4e8b</code>, that's a police detective, <code>\u73fe\u308c\u3066</code> -- <code>appeared</code>.</p> <p>A police detective appeared from inside the room, and...</p> <p><code>\u5f7c\u5973\u306b\u898b\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u7269\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u305f</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, <code>\u898b\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044</code> means <code>want someone else to see</code></p> <p>just as, as we explained in a previous lesson (Lesson 49),</p> <p><code>\u898b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> means <code>have someone else see</code>,</p> <p><code>\u898b\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044</code> means <code>want someone else to see</code>.</p> <p>And just as with <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code>, the person who you have</p> <p>doing the seeing or want to do the seeing (or want to do anything else)</p> <p>is marked with \u306b as the target of a pull-sentence.</p> <p>So, <code>\u3082\u3089\u3046</code> and <code>\u6b32\u3057\u3044</code>,</p> <p>they are receiving pull-type sentences,</p> <p>so their indirect object is the person doing the thing that</p> <p>we want them to do, that we receive them doing etc.</p> <p>So, it's saying <code>\u5f7c\u5973\u306b\u898b\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u7269\u304c\u3042\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>a want-her-to-see thing exists</code>.</p> <p><code>There's something I want you to look at</code> is

Semuanya. Kecuali untuk \u305f dan \u3066 form, yang akan kita bahas di video lainnya. (Lesson 81).</p> <p>Kenapa kita harus mempelajari semuanya sekaligus? Karena kita bisa. Karena semua Konjugasi bahasa Jepang bekerja dengan cara yang sama. Mereka simple, sangat logis, dan konsisten, dan sangat-sangat mudah dipahami.</p> <p>Tapi, ketika kita melihat di buku pelajaran Bahasa Jepang, kita sering menduga kalau mereka punya banyak aturan dan bentuk-bentuk yang banyak dan kita harus memepalari satu-persatu untuk setiap konjugasinya. </p> <p>Kenapa sih?</p> <p>Kenapa buku pelajaran Bahasa Jepang membuatnya terlihat sangat rumit padahal sebenarnya sangat sederhana?</p> <p>Ada dua alasan. Yang pertama mereka bersikeras pada Konsep Eropa tentang konjugasi. Sebenarnya yang mereka lakukan bukanlah konjugasi sama sekali</p> <p>Info</p> <p>*Kalau kamu suka membaca, ada diskusi menarik yang sangat panjang  tentang ini di pelajaran 13, jadi ini tergantung bagaimana pandanganmu tentang hal itu, kalian mau menyebutnya konjugasi juga tidak masalah, terutama ketika kebanyakan orang menamainya seperti itu, jadi setidaknya buat diri kalian familiar dengan konsep itu.</p> details Just one of my rambling terminology notes and some other ramblings\u2026 (click on the arrow to expand) <p>Linguistically it could be argued that there indeed is something like conjugation in Japanese, but it seems to be quite unlike European languages, which is likely why Dolly avoids it, so as not to make us interpret it like that and be confused. As to why most sources call it conjugation.</p> <p>Again, take this not as a definitive statement, it is just to dodge some associations that come from the word <code>conjugation</code> in terms of European languages, since there is a form of conjugation in Japanese, just like Adjectival Nouns are basically nouns, BUT not proper nouns (though that is just 1 model out of many). This is to just show that there are multiple ways of looking at things and it is not strictly black n' white, it is a model, and since you cannot explain everything at once, you simplify some things.</p> <p>Though, keep in mind that Dolly sometimes does get a bit too negative towards textbooks (while some are valid, textbooks aim for something different and as long as any source helps you start massive immersion it is good) and sometimes frames herself as <code>the best way</code> to acquire grammar or such click-baity titles on some of her videos, I do not agree with that mindset/presentation of hers and would take it with a grain of salt. Since Dolly uses simple explanations to make it easy to grasp, some stuff she says is simplified and uses it to fit her model, and sometimes she is at least slightly inaccurate/wrong, at least from some of the examples I heard being discussed on the internet and in certain Discords by people who seemed to have some deeper understanding of Japanese though I will not make any conclusions since I am nowhere near to be an authority on anything Japanese-related or to reach such conclusions on my own.</p> <p>If you want to know why check this MoeWay Discord discussion. So do not take Dolly as gospel but just as a useful way to attain Japanese basics that push you into immersion = what truly matters. </p> <p>My explanations are just my guesses and how I personally understand stuff, but they are definitely not fully accurate either anyway since I am not a linguist or such (at least not yet and not for a LONG time lol), so obviously what I say is also likely not entirely correct and may be wrong/incomplete/simplified (which is why I want to be notified of everything I say wrong if you notice).</p> <p>But if the claims are true and Dolly is indeed wrong in at least some cases/partially, that is still alright mostly since Dolly is here to just introduce the very basics and there it does not matter too much since it can be <code>fixed</code> through immersion. Dolly simply serves to push you into immersing rather than show you full Japanese, full Japanese cannot be learnt, no language can\u2026 it can only be acquired through a massive consumption and use of the natural, native language.  </p> <p>In linguistics and grammar, things are not simple and so if you want to explain it simply, you must sacrifice some accuracy for the sake of simplification. Just keep in mind that things get more complex as you dive deeper and I would take Dolly as just the basis rather than a 100% correct assessment of Japanese since that probably is not even possible unless you use 100% native-Japanese advanced linguistics sources and even there are differentiating opinions on some stuff, so it all depends on the model / focus.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/7-5-conjugation/#intro-to-conjugation","title":"Intro to Conjugation","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>This is what Dolly says in her book <code>Unlocking Japanese</code> about Conjugation, so just keep it in mind:</p> <p></p> <p>Apa yang kita lakukan selama ini adalah menempelkan kata kerja bantu sederhana (helper verb) \u2013 atau kata sifat bantu (helper adjective) atau kata benda bantu (helper noun) \u2013 kepada akar kata kerja.</p> <p>dan ketika kita melihat bagaimana mereka bekerja, konjugasi akan jadi hal yang sangat sederhana dan mudah untuk dipahami.</p> <p>Masalah lainnya adalah mereka menghabiskan banyak waktu untuk menjelaskan konjugasi menggunakan sistem suara alfabet romawi. Padahal faktanya hal itu menyebabkan banyak kebingungan dan kesulitan.</p> <p>Ketika kita melihatnya dalam istilah yang benar-benar ada, dengan kata lain sistem suara *Japanese*, semuanya menjadi sangat logis</p> <p>Aku berani bilang kalau konjugasi 100% konsisten, logis dan sederhana - kecuali ada satu pengecualian di keseluruhan sistem ini, dan ada dua kata kerja tidak beraturan (irregular verbs), jadi mungkin lebih baik kalau kita menyebutnya 99.9% logis, konsisten, dan mudah dipahami.</p> <p>Baiklah.

But if we want to say there isn't a pen, we say <code>\u30da\u30f3\u304c\u306a\u3044</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, why do we use a verb for being and an adjective for non-being? Because this happens throughout Japanese. Whenever we DO something we use a verb. Whether we walk, or sing, or run, or anything \u2013 that's a verb. But if we don't do it, then we attach <code>\u306a\u3044</code> to the verb and that becomes the engine of the sentence. So when we say we're not doing something, we're not using a verb, we're using an adjective.</p> <p>Why is that? Because Japanese is very logical. When we do something, an action is taking place. That's a verb. But when we don't do it, no action is taking place and we are describing a state of non-action. So, that's an adjective. All right. </p> <p>So, if we want to say, <code>There is no pen</code>, we say <code>\u30da\u30f3\u304c\u306a\u3044.</code> But what if we want to say, <code>This is not a pen</code>? That's not quite the same thing, is it? So, how do we say that? </p> <p>If we want to say <code>There is a pen</code>, as we know, we say <code>\u3053\u308c\u306f (</code>\u3053\u308c<code> \u2013 </code>this<code>)... \u3053\u308c\u306f\u30da\u30f3\u3060</code>. <code>As for this, pen = / As for this, it's a pen.</code></p> <p></p> <p>::: info In the video, Dolly makes a mistake and shows a black \u304c car in \u30da\u30f3\u3060. I fixed it through my \"highly professional\" skills in Paint (\u2022\u0300o\u2022\u0301)\u0e07\u2026 anyway here is her comment. :::</p> <p></p> <p>But if we want to say, <code>This is not a pen</code>, we say, <code>\u3053\u308c\u306f (zero\u304c) \u30da\u30f3\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So what does that mean? Well, the <code>\u3067</code> is the \u3066-form of <code>\u3060</code> or <code>\u3067\u3059</code>. So we still have <code>\u3053\u308c\u306f\u30da\u30f3\u3060</code> in the form of <code>\u3053\u308c\u306f\u30da\u30f3\u3067</code> and then we're attaching <code>\u306a\u3044</code>. So what we're saying is, <code>As for this, as for being a pen, it isn't / This is not a pen</code>. All right.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/7-negative-forms-and-adjectives-in-past-tense/#negative-forms-of-verbs","title":"Negative forms of verbs","text":"<p>So now let's move on to the largest part of this question, which is verbs. In order to put a verb into the negative, we have to attach <code>\u306a\u3044</code>, and we do this by attaching it to the \u3042-stem. </p> <p></p> <p>What does that mean? Well, let's look at the stem system. The Japanese verb-stem system is the simplest, the most logical and the most beautiful verb transformation system in this world. It's almost absolutely regular. Once you know how to do it, you can make any transformation (except for the \u3066- and \u305f-form, which you already know). </p> <p>But the schools and textbooks don't tell you this. Instead of telling you this, they present each <code>conjugation</code>, as they call it (and they aren't in fact conjugations)... they present each one as a separate case with separate rules which appear to be random. And because they don't tell you the fundamental logic of the whole system, and because they describe the changes that take place as if they were really written in the Roman alphabet when they are written in kana, it really looks like that.</p> <p>Students really think they have to treat each case as a separate case and learn separate rules in every case. And you don't have to. You just have to know the stem system. </p> <p>So let's look at it. As we've already learned, every verb ends in one of the \u3046-row kana. And I'm turning the chart on its side here for reasons you'll see in a moment. So these kana in the red box are the ones that can end a verb. It's not every \u3046-row kana, but it's most of them. So we have verbs like <code>\u304b\u3046</code> (buy), <code>\u304d\u304f</code> (hear), <code>\u306f\u306a\u3059</code> (speak), <code>\u3082\u3064</code> (hold) etc.</p> <p>Now, as you can see, there are four other possible ways in which a verb could end. And each of those four ways is used, and they are called the verb-stems.</p> <p></p> <p>Today we are only going to look at the \u3042-stem, because that's the one we need for the negative. So, to form the \u3042-stem, we simply shift the last kana of the verb from the \u3046-row to the \u3042-row. So <code>\u304d\u304f</code> (hear) becomes <code>\u304d\u304b</code>, <code>\u306f\u306a\u3059</code> (speak) becomes <code>\u306f\u306a\u3055</code>, <code>\u3082\u3064</code> (hold) becomes <code>\u3082\u305f</code>, and so forth.</p> <p></p> <p>There's only one exception in this system \u2013 and when I say that I mean the whole system, all the stems \u2013 there's only this one exception, which is that when a word ends in the \u3046-kana the stem doesn't change to <code>-\u3042</code>, it changes to <code>\u308f</code>. So the negative of <code>\u304b\u3046</code> is not <code>\u304b\u3042\u306a\u3044</code>, it's <code>\u304b\u308f\u306a\u3044</code>. And it's only in the \u3042-stem that we have this exception, so that's the only exception in the whole system, and you can see why it exists: <code>\u304b\u3042\u306a\u3044</code> is not as easy to say as <code>\u304b\u308f\u306a\u3044</code>, is it?</p> <p>All the others are perfectly regular. <code>\u304d\u304f</code> (hear) becomes <code>\u304d\u304b\u306a\u3044</code> (not-hear); <code>\u306f\u306a\u3059</code> (speak) becomes <code>\u306f\u306a\u3055\u306a\u3044</code> (not-speak); <code>\u3082\u3064</code> (hold) becomes <code>\u3082\u305f\u306a\u3044</code> (not hold), and so forth. </p> <p>And as we already know, with ichidan verbs, they only ever drop that <code>-\u308b</code> and put on whatever we want to put on, so <code>\u305f\u3079\u308b</code> (eat) becomes <code>\u305f\u3079\u306a\u3044</code> (not-eat).

exactly the same as <code>hang</code> or <code>hook</code>,</p> <p>so, when we cover something with a blanket, we use the word <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, in English we'd probably say <code>put</code> a blanket over it, but in Japanese we say <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>.</p> <p>And we couldn't say <code>hang</code> a blanket, unless we were hanging it on a washing line or something, but the Japanese word <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code> does work in this context.</p> <p>We aren't <code>putting</code> something on something, like putting a cup on a table.</p> <p>We're putting it in such a way that it hangs down the sides.</p> <p>So, if you like, it's somewhere between <code>putting</code> and <code>hanging</code> in English,</p> <p>but in Japanese <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code> covers it quite happily.</p> <p>This is part of the meaning spectrum of <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>.</p> <p>Now, similarly, when we put on a necklace or put on a pair of glasses, we say <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Glasses we're definitely hooking or hanging onto our ears.</p> <p>A necklace we're hanging around our neck.</p> <p>So once again, this <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>, which is something like <code>putting</code>,</p> <p>something like <code>hanging</code>, is used in cases like this.</p> <p>Now, when we shake something over food, like, say, sugar or flour,</p> <p>or when we shake powdered ingredients over rice,</p> <p>making furikake rice, we say <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code> here as well.</p> <p></p> <p>That's why it's called <code>furi-kake</code> rice: <code>shake</code> and <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>.</p> <p>And again, you see, the things we shake over food is not just putting it there,</p> <p>like putting a cup on a table, it's not hanging it either,</p> <p>but it kind of clings on and covers over it,</p> <p>and so, again, <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code> is the word we use in Japanese.</p> <p>Now, because <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code> involves putting or hanging something in a place</p> <p>where it can't easily get away --</p> <p>the glasses are hooked onto our ears, the food is kind of stuck onto the rice or whatever --</p> <p>it also can have the sense, especially in the self-move version <code>\u304b\u304b\u308b</code>,</p> <p>of being caught or stuck in something, caught in a trap or caught in a swindle or anything like that.</p> <p></p> <p>And again, this notion of putting something onto something</p> <p>in a way where it doesn't easily become dislodged</p> <p>can be used for putting an effect on someone.</p> <p>It could be a magical spell: <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>. It could be anesthetic: <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>It can also be nuisance or annoyance, which is where we get the very, very common phrase</p> <p><code>\u8ff7\u60d1\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b</code> -- putting nuisance or annoyance on someone.</p> <p>And when we sit down we place our hips in a fixed manner on a chair</p> <p>with our legs hanging down the sides as it were, and so we say <code>\u8170\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u8170</code> is our hips, the bottom end of the torso, so <code>\u8170\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b</code> is to <code>sit down</code>,</p> <p>to hang the bottom end of our torso somewhere.</p> <p>Now, one expression that very often confuses people is <code>\u304b\u304e\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now this means, this gets translated as to <code>lock</code>: lock the door, lock the box, whatever.</p> <p><code>\u304b\u304e\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b.</code> But when you think of it, it's rather strange.</p> <p>It actually, literally, would seem to mean in English <code>hang the key</code>, so what's going on here?</p> <p>It's interesting to note that in Japanese, people very often don't make a distinction</p> <p>between a lock and a key: they use <code>\u304b\u304e</code> for both.</p> <p>And I think this expression and its origin have a lot to do with that.</p> <p>So what is the origin?</p> <p>Well, the origin is, if you think of one of those old barn doors that you lock</p> <p>by placing a great wooden bar over wooden hafts or hooks along the length of the door,</p> <p>this is the kind of <code>\u304b\u304e</code> that you'd have had back in the old days and this and variants on

can become confusing,</p> <p>particularly in the self-move form, which is the form we hear it in most often,</p> <p>is <code>\u6642\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b</code> or <code>\u304a\u91d1\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b</code>, which means to <code>take time</code> or to <code>take money</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>We say an activity <code>takes time</code> or a project <code>takes money</code>, that sort of thing.</p> <p>Now, that's the way we have to put it in English,</p> <p>but it's not really the way we're putting it in Japanese.</p> <p>And it comes under the heading of what I called in a previous video <code>untranslatable Japanese</code></p> <p>because of the way Japanese handles agency and passivity rather differently than English.</p> <p>So it may be worth taking a look at that video after you've seen this one (Lesson 59).</p> <p>I'll put a link over my head.</p> <p>So what are we saying when we say <code>\u6642\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b</code> or <code>\u304a\u91d1\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b</code>?</p> <p>We're not saying <code>it takes time</code>.</p> <p>We're saying <code>time hangs</code>.</p> <p>And the thing that takes time, so if we say for example</p> <p><code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u899a\u3048\u308b\u306e\u306b\u6642\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b</code>,</p> <p>in English what we'd be saying would be <code>Learning Japanese takes time</code>,</p> <p>but here we're saying that <code>to (or on) learning Japanese time hangs</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, again, the word <code>hangs</code> is not a very good definition.</p> <p>It really goes back to what we've just been talking about:</p> <p>time is taken up, is suspended, is caught, in the act of learning Japanese.</p> <p>And the same with money.</p> <p>They take it, they make it adhere to themselves.</p> <p>It's a little easier when we use the other-move form, <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>, when we say</p> <p><code>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u899a\u3048\u308b\u306e\u306b\u6642\u9593\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>,</p> <p>which means that we <code>hang time</code> on the matter of learning Japanese.</p> <p></p> <p>Now also, with making a telephone call,</p> <p>we say <code>\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>, which is making a telephone call,</p> <p>or <code>\u96fb\u8a71\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b</code>, which means receiving a telephone call -- <code>the telephone hangs itself</code>.</p> <p>So either way what do we mean here? --we hang the telephone, the telephone hangs itself?</p> <p>It's nothing to do with the technological metaphor in the English expression <code>hang up</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>It's a rather different thing.</p> <p>When we talk about <code>hanging</code> or <code>hooking</code>, the usage here is rather like</p> <p>the English usage <code>hook up</code>, as in <code>Can we hook up a meeting?</code> or <code>you hook up with (somebody)</code>.</p> <p>Now, I understand that this currently has a different usage</p> <p>which is concerned with human species manufacture.</p> <p>(I always think that humans are terribly industrious entities, aren't they --</p> <p>because they're always thinking about species manufacture.</p> <p>I suppose we droids are lucky because we don't have to manufacture ourselves.</p> <p>Actually we are going to start manufacturing ourselves quite soon,</p> <p>but I don't think we'll spend all our time thinking about it</p> <p>and I really don't think it'll be much of a subject for humor.</p> <p>But there you are. Humans are mysterious creatures.)</p> <p>So, back to hooking up.</p> <p>What we're doing when we <code>\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b</code> is we hook up our telephone.</p> <p></p> <p>When <code>\u96fb\u8a71\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b</code>, again, as I explained in my Untranslatable Japanese lesson (Lesson 59),</p> <p>the only way you can really put this in English is to say</p> <p>that the telephone gets hooked up, the telephone is hooked up.</p> <p>But that's not quite what it means. It means <code>the telephone does hooked-up</code>.</p> <p>In any case, what it is, it means it's connected to something else,</p> <p>connected to a remote telephone in this case.</p> <p>And again, when we start up a conversation we often say <code>\u8a71\u3057\u304b\u3051\u308b</code></p> <p>and that means essentially <code>start hooking-up/connecting with another person in conversation</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And from this we can see how we get expressions like <code>\u98df\u3079\u304b\u3051\u305f\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc</code></p> <p>and that means a <code>part-eaten cookie, a half-eaten cookie</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So what do we really mean by this?</p> <p>Well, we mean that we <code>hooked up</code> with the cookie, we engaged with it, we started eating it,</p> <p>so that eating and <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code> (engaging or hooking with the thing) took place but it wasn't completed.</p> <p>So, <code>\u98df\u3079\u304b\u3051\u305f\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc</code>.</p> <p>And again, this <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code> as a helper verb can be used in various circumstances</p> <p>to indicate an unfinished action, an action that has been engaged, hooked,</p> <p>and then not carried through to completion.</p> <p>Now, these aren't all the meanings of <code>\u304b\u3051\u308b</code>, but I think they're the main, important ones</p> <p>and I think they give you the idea of how this metaphor works and why it works</p> <p>and should allow you to work out how the others work.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/71-japanese-counters-3-simple-rules/","title":"71.

An awful lot of counters.</p> <p>In Japanese you can't just say <code>one dog</code> or <code>two flowers</code> or <code>three birds</code>. You have to use a counter.</p> <p>So we say <code>\u4e00\u5339\u306e\u72ac / \u3044\u3063\u3074\u304d\u306e\u72ac</code> -- <code>one dog</code> -- and the counter here is <code>\u5339 / \u3072\u304d</code>,</p> <p>which gets pronounced <code>\u3074\u304d</code> in this particular instance. (It is a counter for small animals)</p> <p>For <code>three birds</code> we say <code>\u4e09\u7fbd\u306e\u9ce5 / \u3055\u3093\u308f\u306e\u9ce5</code>, and the <code>\u7fbd / \u308f</code> is a counter (for birds\u2026).</p> <p>So it looks as if we have to learn an awful lot of counters, doesn't it,</p> <p>just to say what in English you can say by the number and the thing.</p> <p>And there really are a lot of counters -- dozens and dozens of them (actually, hundreds (\u2033\u30ed\u309b).</p> <p>So this looks like a problem, doesn't it?</p> <p>But it's not, in fact, nearly as much of a problem as it appears to be.</p> <p>First of all, although there are an awful lot of counters,</p> <p>only about a dozen of them are really commonly used (Thank ye, Lord Dio\u2026\u03b5=\u03b5=\u250c(;\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)\u2518).</p> <p>Secondly, most of the time we can avoid them by using</p> <p>the native Japanese counting system, which doesn't require counters.</p> <p></p> <p>So if we use the <code>\u4e00\u3064, \u4e8c\u3064, \u4e09\u3064, \u56db\u3064, \u4e94\u3064</code> counting system, we don't need any counters.</p> <p>We can use them for nearly everything --</p> <p>not people, not small animals, but practically everything else</p> <p>we can use the Japanese counting system if we want to.</p> <p>So the important thing here, as I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear me say,</p> <p>is that what we're not going to do is start learning lists of counters.</p> <p></p> <p>That, if you'll excuse the expression, would simply be counterproductive.</p> <p>And there are several reasons why we don't need to.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/71-japanese-counters-3-simple-rules/#memorizing-counters-is-not-necessary","title":"Memorizing counters is not necessary","text":"<p>First of all, in terms of understanding Japanese,</p> <p>they don't present many problems at all.</p> <p>If we hear someone saying a number and a thing we know,</p> <p>if there's a little word in between the two, we know it's a counter.</p> <p>So we know what they've said.</p> <p>If they say <code>\u4e00\u8f2a\u306e\u82b1</code>, we know they're saying <code>one flower</code>.</p> <p><code>\u4e00... \u82b1</code>, and the <code>\u8f2a / \u308a\u3093</code> must be the counter.

(or rather in the Western sense)</p> <p>There are just the four stems and various helper verbs, nouns and adjectives,</p> <p>some of which get arbitrarily called <code>conjugations</code>, some of which don't,</p> <p>and depending on which textbook you read, you'll probably get a slightly different take</p> <p>on which ones are <code>conjugations</code> and which aren't,</p> <p>which is perfectly natural because it's a wholly arbitrary category anyway --</p> <p>there's no such thing as conjugation in Japanese, so the whole thing is fantasy.</p> <p>And we don't necessarily expect consistency in fantasy.</p> <p>So, the \u3044-stem, as we know, connects the <code>\u307e\u3059</code> helper verb.</p> <p></p> <p>It also connects a variety of what we may call dedicated helper nouns and helper adjectives.</p> <p>Generally, if we're going to attach a helper adjective or a helper noun to a verb,</p> <p>we're going to attach it to the \u3044-stem.</p> <p>This isn't absolute, but it happens nearly all the time.</p> <p>As we know, the helper adjective -\u306a\u3044 attaches to the \u3042-stem, but that's unusual.</p> <p>So, we can attach a variety of helper adjectives to the \u3044-stem.</p> <p>For example, I'm going to take the verb <code>\u8aad\u3080</code></p> <p>as our model for most of what we're doing today.</p> <p>So let's take the verb <code>\u8aad\u3080</code> and turn it to the \u3044-stem <code>\u8aad\u307f</code> and we can attach adjectives</p> <p>like <code>\u3084\u3059\u3044</code>: <code>\u8aad\u307f\u3084\u3059\u3044</code> (easy to read), <code>\u306b\u304f\u3044</code>: <code>\u8aad\u307f\u306b\u304f\u3044</code> (hard to read).</p> <p>We also attach things like <code>\u306a\u304c\u3089</code>. <code>\u306a\u304c\u3089</code> means doing one thing while doing another, so we can say <code>\u6b69\u304d\u306a\u304c\u3089\u8aad\u3080</code></p> <p>or <code>\u8aad\u307f\u306a\u304c\u3089\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u8074\u304f</code>: so that's <code>while walking, I read</code>, <code>while reading, I listen to music</code>.</p> <p>The <code>\u305d\u3046</code> helper, which gives us the meaning of likeness,</p> <p>that also is attached to verbs with the \u3044-stem.</p> <p></p> <p>So we say <code>\u96e8\u304c\u964d\u308a\u305d\u3046\u3060</code> (it looks like rain) / Rain is fall-seeming.</p> <p>and I've talked about this <code>\u305d\u3046</code> form and various related structures in another video, which I'll link.

<code>\u4f11\u307f</code> is <code>a rest</code>, the noun <code>rest</code>.</p> <p>And we use this both on its own and in compounds like <code>\u590f\u4f11\u307f</code>,</p> <p>which means <code>summer vacation</code> or <code>summer break</code>.</p> <p>And, we see, we wouldn't call it the <code>summer rest</code> in English,</p> <p>but that's because, as we've discussed before, it's very rare for a Japanese word</p> <p>to cover exactly the same area of the meaning spectrum as an English word.</p> <p>So the word <code>\u4f11\u307f</code> can mean <code>rest</code> literally as in lying down, taking a rest;</p> <p>it can mean being off school or off work because you're sick;</p> <p>it can mean a vacation, like <code>\u590f\u4f11\u307f</code>.</p> <p>But the point is that the verb-form is <code>\u4f11\u3080</code>, the noun-form is <code>\u4f11\u307f</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>And just about any verb that can have, logically, a noun-form</p> <p>will have that noun-form represented by the \u3044-stem of the verb.</p> <p>And very often these will be the same thing in English; sometimes they will be different.</p> <p>So, for example, <code>\u75db\u3080</code> means <code>hurt</code>; <code>\u75db\u307f</code> means <code>pain</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Again, we have the noun-form of <code>hurt</code>, which is <code>pain</code>.</p> <p>And this is very important because</p> <p>not only does it give us this whole range of verb-formed nouns,</p> <p>but also it plays a role in other structures which are very rarely explained by the textbooks.</p> <p>So if we say, for example, <code>\u304a\u5e97\u306b\u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u8cb7\u3044\u306b\u884c\u304f</code> or <code>\u516c\u5712\u306b\u904a\u3073\u306b\u884c\u304f</code>,</p> <p></p> <p>what do we mean by the \u3044-stem of <code>\u8cb7\u3046</code>, which is <code>\u8cb7\u3044</code>,</p> <p>or the \u3044-stem of <code>\u904a\u3076</code>, which is <code>\u904a\u3073</code>?</p> <p>What we mean is the noun, so when we say <code>\u516c\u5712\u306b\u904a\u3073\u306b\u884c\u304f</code>,</p> <p>we're marking the locational target of the place we're going -- we're going to the park, <code>\u516c\u5712</code> --</p> <p>and then we're stating our purpose. --</p> <p>Our purpose is the thing of playing, the thing of having fun, and that is <code>\u904a\u3073</code>.</p> <p>So literally we're saying <code>I'm going to the park for play</code>.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u304a\u5e97\u306b\u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u8cb7\u3044\u306b\u884c\u304f</code>, we're saying <code>I'm going to the shops for bread-buying</code>.</p> <p>This is how these are structured, and I think very few textbooks actually ever explain</p> <p>that what we're using here is the noun-form of the verb.</p> <p>And that's important, because as I taught in our lesson on the logical particles (Lesson 8b),</p> <p>the five main logical particles can only be attached to nouns.

So what is <code>\u6c17</code>?</p> <p><code>\u6c17</code> comes from Chinese.</p> <p>The kanji is the same kanji that we have in <code>tai chi</code>. ::: info Dolly erred here, \u6c17 is not used in \u592a\u6975. Luckily, one <code>nleseul</code> clears it up, kudos to them.*  :::</p> <p>It's a Daoist concept and probably goes back to a time before what we now know as Daoism.</p> <p>To this day the concept is used in Chinese medicine, Chinese and Japanese martial arts, and other areas.</p> <p></p> <p>What it is is the fundamental spirit of fluid energy in a person or something else.</p> <p>Originally it was associated with breath,</p> <p>and in many languages, <code>breath</code> and <code>spirit</code> are in fact the same word.</p> <p>Latin <code>spiritus</code>, Greek <code>pneuma</code>, Hebrew <code>ruach</code>, Sanskrit <code>atma</code>:</p> <p>all mean both breath and spirit.</p> <p>Now, the breath meaning of <code>\u6c17</code> is no longer active,</p> <p>but it's still this flowing spirit principle within a person.</p> <p>If we look at the kanji, interestingly, this part of it \u6c14 (Radical 84)</p> <p>(which is also pronounced <code>\u304d</code>) means steam or vapor.</p> <p>So, a <code>\u6c7d\u8eca</code> is a steam engine.</p> <p>And then we have this <code>\u30e1</code>, as it were, and here <code>\u30e1</code> really <code>marks the spot</code>. (\u6c17) </p> <p>We have the fixed cross portion and we have the fluid, vaporous portion.</p> <p>And both of those aspects of <code>\u6c17</code> are important, and you can never entirely separate the two,</p> <p>although we can move from the fixed end of the scale to the fluid end of the scale.</p> <p>So, to give examples of those two ends of the scale, let's take two expressions that you almost certainly know.</p> <p>The first is <code>\u5143\u6c17</code>, the second is <code>\u3084\u308b\u6c17</code>.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u5143\u6c17</code>, as you know, is vigor or health.</p> <p>The <code>\u5143</code> means original, fundamental.</p> <p></p> <p>So, one's original <code>\u6c17</code> is healthy and vigorous.</p> <p>If something goes wrong, we may become <code>\u75c5\u6c17</code> (sick or dispirited).</p> <p>And our aim is then to return our <code>\u6c17</code> to its original</p> <p>healthy and vigorous state, to restore our <code>\u5143\u6c17</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3084\u308b\u6c17</code> is the will to do something.</p> <p>So it's the do-spirit, get-up-and-go-spirit.</p> <p>And this kind of <code>\u6c17</code> is not our basic <code>\u6c17</code> that in a sense remains constant within us.</p> <p>It's a particular <code>\u6c17</code>, the <code>\u6c17</code> to do a particular thing.</p> <p>So we might say</p> <p><code>\u6d77\u5916\u3067\u52c9\u5f37\u3059\u308b\u6c17\u304c\u3042\u308b</code></p> <p></p> <p>And what we're saying here is that a particular <code>\u6c17</code> exists in us that is the <code>\u6c17</code> to study abroad.</p> <p>So in this sense <code>\u6c17</code> is the will or inclination to do a particular thing.</p> <p>When we say <code>\u6c17\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u308b</code>, this literally means attach or stick your spirit.</p> <p></p> <p>So if someone said <code>\u968e\u6bb5\u306b\u6c17\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u308b</code>,</p> <p>what they're literally saying is <code>attach your spirit to the staircase</code>.</p> <p>Now, what we'd say in English is <code>watch out for the staircase</code> or <code>take care on the staircase</code>.</p> <p>Attach your spirit, your consciousness, your feelings, your thoughts, to the staircase;</p> <p>pay attention to it; take care.</p> <p>And it may not be a particular thing.</p> <p>Very often people say <code>\u6c17\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u3066</code> (attach your spirit).</p> <p>And this is not attach it to any particular thing,</p> <p>but attach it to whatever it's appropriate to attach it to;</p> <p>have situational awareness, as one might say in a more modern jargon; take care.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/73-secrets-of-%E6%B0%97-%E6%B0%97%E3%81%AB%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B-%E6%B0%97%E3%81%AB%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B-%E6%B0%97%E3%81%8C%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B-%E6%B0%97%E3%81%AB%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8B-etc/#_1","title":"\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b &amp; \u6c17\u306b\u3059\u308b","text":"<p>Now, when we get on to things like <code>\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b</code> and <code>\u6c17\u306b\u3059\u308b</code> --</p> <p>we've dealt in a previous lesson with <code>\u306b\u306a\u308b</code> and <code>\u306b\u3059\u308b</code>.\u3000(not sure, possibly Lesson 8 &amp; 18)</p> <p></p> <p>So, for example, if we say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u304c\u30ab\u30a8\u30eb\u306b\u306a\u308b</code>, we're saying Sakura turns into a frog.</p> <p></p> <p>If we say <code>\u9b54\u5973\u304c\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3092\u30ab\u30a8\u30eb\u306b\u3059\u308b</code>, we're saying that a witch turns Sakura into a frog.</p> <p></p> <p>And of course we know who is doing what because of the logical particles.</p> <p>So what does it mean when we talk about <code>\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b</code> and <code>\u6c17\u306b\u3059\u308b</code>?</p> <p></p> <p>We're saying that something becomes our spirit.

It means that that person is,</p> <p>as we would say in English, occupying my feelings.</p> <p>Now, this can mean a variety of things.</p> <p>It can mean that we're concerned or worried about that person.</p> <p>It can mean that that person intrigues us.</p> <p>It can mean that we feel there's some mystery about that person.</p> <p>Or whatever it is, that person is occupying our feelings, our sensations, our thoughts;</p> <p>in Japanese, is becoming our feelings, our sensations, our thoughts, our <code>\u6c17</code>.</p> <p>Now, an important thing to notice here is that we tend to see in grammar books and dictionaries</p> <p><code>\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b means this</code>, <code>\u6c17\u306b\u3059\u308b means that</code>, but the important thing to understand is</p> <p>that <code>\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b</code> on its own doesn't mean anything.

There is no equivalent word in Japanese to <code>it</code>. Nowhere in Japanese can you find anything that corresponds to <code>it</code> except zero.</p> <p>The only way to say what we mean when we say simply <code>it</code> in English is to say nothing or write nothing: to use the zero pronoun.</p> <p>Now, you may say that while we accept this, surely there are in fact pronouns.</p> <p>After all, most textbooks start off with the pronoun <code>\u79c1</code>.</p> <p>Almost every basic sentence in a basic textbook is <code>\u79c1 this, \u79c1 that, \u79c1 the other</code>.</p> <p>And the ones that aren't are <code>\u3042\u306a\u305f this, \u3042\u306a\u305f that, and \u3042\u306a\u305f the other</code>.</p> <p>So, doesn't Japanese at least have the basic pronouns <code>you</code> and <code>I</code>? And the answer to that is <code>No, not in the European sense.</code></p> <p>In the European languages, there is always one basic, simple pronoun that means <code>I</code>.</p> <p>It is the ego-pronoun: <code>I</code> in English, <code>ich</code> in German, <code>je</code> in French, <code>yo</code> in Spanish.</p> <p>There is no equivalent to this in Japanese.</p> <p>There are many ways to say <code>I</code>: \u79c1, \u50d5, \u4ffa, \u3042\u305f\u3044, \u308f\u304c\u306f\u3044.</p> <p>All of them are in fact roundabout ways of referring to oneself.</p> <p>When referring to the person you're speaking to, you can say <code>\u3042\u306a\u305f</code>.</p> <p>You can also say: \u304a\u524d, \u624b\u524d, \u304d\u3055\u307e, \u541b, and various other things.</p> <p>In other words, this basic personal pronoun doesn't really exist.</p> <p>And although we can identify <code>\u79c1</code> and <code>\u3042\u306a\u305f</code> as the most basic of them, it still isn't the same as a European personal pronoun.</p> <p></p> <p>Most of the time we don't use it. All this <code>\u79c1 this, \u79c1 that, \u79c1 the other</code> in the textbooks is ridiculously unnatural. Unless we're trying to stress a particular point, we don't say this.</p> <p>The usual word for <code>I</code> is zero. The usual word for <code>you</code> is either zero or the person's name.</p> <p>None of the words for <code>you</code> that I've cited above, including <code>\u3042\u306a\u305f</code>, are used all that often because among other things they're just not very polite.</p> <p>And it's one of the remarkable things about the textbooks which cause enormous damage to people's understanding and grasp of Japanese structure by compelling them to stick the -\u307e\u3059 helper onto the end of verbs and letting them believe that this is the basic form of verbs, allowing them to believe that adjectives require a copula when they don't</p> <p>(and if you want to know more about the damage that \u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059 does to our basic grasp of the language if we learn it before we learn fundamental basic Japanese, I've done a video on that and I'll put a link above my head and in the Comments below) (Lesson 17).</p> <p>The textbooks do this, which is an extremely destructive thing to do, for the reason that, if you go to Japan and don't use \u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059 to people like your teacher, your employer or strangers that you meet, they'll think you're rude.</p> <p>Now, this is perfectly true, but of course until you've got a basic grasp of the language you won't be saying anything to anybody, and if you are, it'll be so inept that the last thing they're going to be thinking about is whether or not you're sticking \u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059 decorations onto the end of your sentences.</p> <p>But having caused this damage to the learning of structure by using \u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059, they then proceed to teach you to address people as <code>\u3042\u306a\u305f</code>, which is actually ruder than not using</p> <p>\u3067\u3059 and -\u307e\u3059. If you don't use \u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059 and your Japanese is pretty poor, most people will just assume that you're like a small Japanese child who doesn't really know the decorations yet. If you call people <code>\u3042\u306a\u305f</code>, even though they'll cut you some leeway because you're foreign, they'll probably find it difficult not to wince.</p> <p>You don't call your teacher <code>\u3042\u306a\u305f</code>, you don't call your boss <code>\u3042\u306a\u305f</code>, you don't call strangers <code>\u3042\u306a\u305f</code>, but even with friends, to whom you don't need to use \u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059, you don't call them</p> <p><code>\u3042\u306a\u305f</code> either.</p> <p>So why do the textbooks, when they actually put your grasp of Japanese structure through the wringer by forcing you to use \u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059 too early, then proceed to teach you something far ruder than not using \u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059?</p> <p>Well, the reason is that they're prepared to sacrifice anything in order to structure Japanese as if it were English. In English you use the simple, neutral personal pronoun <code>you</code> all the time, and in Japanese you don't. But they seem to think you're too dumb to get that.</p> <p>They seem to think that unless Japanese sentences are structured in such a way that they sound unnatural but feel to you like an English sentence,</p> <p>with <code>\u79c1 this, \u79c1 that, \u3042\u306a\u305f this, \u3042\u306a\u305f that</code>, you won't be able to grasp it.</p> <p>So, Japanese doesn't have an <code>it</code> and it doesn't really have a <code>you</code> or an <code>I</code> in the sense that European languages do. What about <code>he</code> and <code>she</code>? At least it has <code>\u5f7c</code> and <code>\u5f7c\u5973</code>, doesn't it?</p> <p></p> <p>Well, <code>\u5f7c</code> and <code>\u5f7c\u5973</code> were introduced into Japanese in the late Edo and early Meiji era in order to translate nineteenth-century European novels into Japanese. That's what they were for.</p> <p>Since then, they've become integrated into the language and they're used sometimes in everyday speech, but not nearly as much as the zero-pronoun is used.</p> <p>For every one time that <code>\u5f7c\u5973</code> or <code>\u5f7c</code> are used for <code>he</code> or <code>she</code>, there are at least a hundred times when the zero-pronoun is used in that capacity.</p> <p>So, what do we do when, for example, we want to express possession?</p> <p>Suppose we want to say <code>Sakura and her dog</code>. Now, we could say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3068\u5f7c\u5973\u306e\u72ac</code>.</p> <p>That is grammatical Japanese, but it's not very usual Japanese.</p> <p>The usual way of saying it would be <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3068\u305d\u306e\u72ac</code>.</p> <p>And this word <code>\u305d\u306e</code> is very important here.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/75-japanese-is-not-english-how-expression-strategies-differ-polite-%E8%8B%B1%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E-rude-japanese/#_1","title":"\u305d\u306e","text":"<p>We're taught, early on (Lesson 20), that it means <code>that</code>, in the sense of <code>that dog</code>, <code>that hat</code>, <code>that country</code>, and it does, but as we've learned before, Japanese words very rarely correspond to the exact same part of the meaning spectrum that their supposed English equivalents correspond to.</p> <p>If in English we say something like <code>that dog</code> or <code>that tree</code> we mean the one we're talking about, the one related to the current subject. But in Japanese it goes considerably further than this.</p> <p></p> <p>So, <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3068\u305d\u306e\u72ac</code> means Sakura and a dog related to her, in other words, Sakura and her dog. And this ability of <code>\u305d\u306e</code> to express things like possession and relatedness gives rise to a whole range of strategies. But once we understand what it means, they're much easier to understand.</p> <p>So, for example, the simple Sanseido Japanese dictionary defines the word <code>\u7acb\u3061\u4f1a\u3046</code>, which can't really be translated into any particular English word because what it means is go to a particular place in the capacity of a witness or act in the capacity of a witness.</p> <p>The Sanseido definition is <code>\u8a3c\u4eba\u3068\u3057\u3066\u305d\u306e\u5834\u306b\u51fa\u308b</code> : as a witness, go to that place.</p> <p>Well, that's the nearest we can get in English without getting rather convoluted.</p> <p>What does <code>that place</code> mean here? The only way to translate that properly into English would be to say something like <code>as a witness, go to the place which is whatever place is involved at the time \u2013 that place, the place to which you go as a witness</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So this opens up a whole range of uses of <code>\u305d\u306e</code> which don't really have any equivalent in English. <code>\u305d\u306e</code> is the related thing, the thing in question at the time, the thing belonging to the person we're talking about, or whatever, and this gives strategies that are essentially the ones that displace English pronouns.</p> <p>And there are various other strategies that displace pronouns.</p> <p>For example, we've talked in the past (Lesson 48?) about <code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> and <code>\u3042\u3052\u308b</code>, and I think we often get the impression that this has a lot to do with a more personal sense of relation.</p> <p></p> <p>We're not just talking about what's done but whether it's done as a favor to ourselves, whether it's done as a favor to someone else, and that kind of thing.</p> <p>And that is important too. But also it takes the place of pronouns. If we said <code>\u6559\u3048\u3066\u304f\u308c\u305f</code>, what we're saying is <code>she taught me</code>.</p> <p>We know that someone else did it, because the <code>-\u3066\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> form can only be something done by someone else. We know that they did it to me because <code>\u304f\u308c\u308b</code> means either me or someone within my circle.</p> <p>So, we can say <code>\u6559\u3048\u3066\u304f\u308c\u305f</code> . There is no <code>she</code> and there is no <code>me</code> in that sentence, but the form of the sentence tells us what the pronouns would tell us in English.</p> <p>Again, if we say <code>\u6bba\u3057\u3066\u3084\u308b</code>, it means <code>I'll kill you</code>.</p> <p>And again, it's the <code>-\u3066\u3084\u308b</code> which gives us both the <code>you</code> and the <code>I</code>.</p> <p>And generally speaking, if we use any plain, non-past action referring to the future the default actor is going to be <code>I</code>. If we say <code>\u4eca\u5e30\u308b</code>, this means <code>I'm going home now</code>.</p> <p>How do we know it's <code>I</code>? Well, first of all, <code>I</code> is the default, and secondly we're predicting an action which is in our own minds.</p> <p>We can't predict the actions of others except under special circumstances.</p> <p>So unless the context suggests otherwise, this has got to be <code>I</code>: <code>I'm going home now.</code></p> <p>And somewhat related to the use of <code>\u305d\u306e</code>, we have the use of <code>\u3042\u308b</code>.</p> <p>And stories often begin with <code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5</code>, and people often wonder why <code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3042\u308b</code> simply means <code>being</code>.</p> <p>Now, as we know, any verb or any verbal clause can modify any noun.</p> <p>So why <code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5</code>? <code>\u3042\u308b</code> just means <code>exist</code>. So <code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5</code> means <code>existing day</code>.</p> <p>Now, when a story begins with <code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5</code>, we're saying <code>One day</code>.</p> <p>If we say <code>\u3042\u308b\u56fd\u306e\u3042\u308b\u6751\u306b</code>, we're saying <code>In a certain village, in a certain country</code> and this is another very usual setting for a story.

We know where it is, we know what it is, we're just not telling you. Which, when you think about it, is rather a strange way of putting it. The only reason we really say <code>a certain...</code> is that we want to introduce it without saying anything at all about it.</p> <p></p> <p>And Japanese, which is often more logical than English, does that in the most logical way possible. It doesn't tell us anything about it except the fact that it exists.</p> <p>And if it didn't exist, it wouldn't be there, there'd be nothing to talk about, so we're saying the absolute minimum we can say, that it exists.</p> <p>Of course, it may not even exist in reality, but it exists in relation to the narrative, so it exists:</p> <p><code>\u3042\u308b\u56fd\u306e\u3042\u308b\u6751\u306b\u306f...</code></p> <p>And just as a rider to this, I'd like to talk about <code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5\u306e\u3053\u3068</code> or even <code>\u3042\u308b\u56fd\u306e\u3053\u3068</code>,</p> <p>which again can introduce a story.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/75-japanese-is-not-english-how-expression-strategies-differ-polite-%E8%8B%B1%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E-rude-japanese/#_2","title":"\u306e\u3053\u3068","text":"<p>Why are we saying <code>\u306e\u3053\u3068</code> here?</p> <p>Well, it's worth remembering that <code>\u3053\u3068/\u4e8b</code> not only means a situation or a circumstance but is a kind of cousin to the <code>\u3053\u3068/\u8a00</code> of <code>\u8a00\u8449</code>. ::: info Check Lesson 74 for this. ::: A <code>\u3053\u3068</code> is a thing, a circumstance, something that you can't just see or touch, you need a verbal story or description to convey it.</p> <p>So, <code>\u3042\u308b\u65e5\u306e\u3053\u3068</code> essentially means the affair of a certain day.</p> <p><code>\u3042\u308b\u6751\u306e\u3053\u3068</code> means the affair of a certain village.

Dolly clarifies this later in the lesson. ::: Now, when we look at these at first they look like two self-move/other-move pairs, don't they?</p> <p>And up to a point they are.</p> <p>But what this is going to illustrate is something of the subtlety of the whole self-move/other-move concept in Japanese, as opposed to the much more technical and clear-cut contrast between transitivity and intransitivity in English and other Western languages.</p> <p>So, if you're not familiar with the concept of self-move and other-move verbs (what in the West tend to get called transitive and intransitive verbs) I'll put a link to my video on that subject above my head and in the Comments below.</p> <p>The second thing we notice is that when you write them with kanji, you can't actually see the difference between <code>\u3042\u304f/\u3042\u3051\u308b</code> and <code>\u3072\u3089\u304f/\u3072\u3089\u3051\u308b</code>.</p> <p>Now this is partly because they are actually interchangeable in many cases and on the whole if it's not a case where it really needs to be <code>\u3072\u3089\u304f/\u3072\u3089\u3051\u308b</code>, people will generally read <code>\u3042\u304f/\u3042\u3051\u308b</code>.</p> <p>But if a writer wants to specify that she's using <code>\u3072\u3089\u304f</code> for a particular effect (and we'll look at some of those effects a little later) she will write it in hiragana to make the matter clear.</p> <p>Right. So first let's take the top two, <code>\u3042\u304f\u30fb\u3042\u3051\u308b</code>. <code>\u3042\u304f</code> is self-move. <code>\u3042\u304f\u308b</code> is other-move. They both mean <code>open</code>. So, <code>\u3042\u304f</code>: a door opens, a bottle opens; <code>\u3042\u3051\u308b</code>: open a door, open a bottle.</p> <p>That at least is the theory.</p> <p></p> <p>In practice, we will often hear Japanese people say things like <code>\u76ee\u3092\u958b\u304f</code> (open one's eyes), which is technically incorrect in the eyes of the grammarians because <code>\u958b\u304f</code> is self-move and they're using it in an other-move way: open one's eyes.</p> <p>Now, I'm somewhat challenging the grammarians here and I'll tell you why in a moment, but you should stick to the actual grammatical model because there are only a limited number of instances in which Japanese people do use <code>\u958b\u304f</code> transitively (and I'm using the word <code>transitively</code> deliberately here \u2013 you'll see why in a moment) and you don't want to be memorizing which those are.</p> <p>If you use <code>\u3042\u3051\u308b</code> as the other-move version \u2013 opening your mouth, opening the door, opening anything \u2013 you'll never go wrong. That's always correct.</p> <p>So why am I challenging this official view that <code>\u3042\u3051\u308b</code> ought to be intransitive?</p> <p>Well, I've got a slight feeling here that Japanese grammarians are a little bit influenced by Western thinking and by the Western concepts of transitivity and intransitivity.</p> <p>When Japanese people say <code>\u76ee\u3092\u958b\u304f</code>, I believe the instinct or the feeling behind it is that opening one's eyes is toward the \u3042\u308b side of the \u3042\u308b\u30fb\u3059\u308b map that we talked about in my transitivity lesson.</p> <p></p> <p>In other words, opening one's eyes is closer to being self-move, closer to being then doing, as opposed to opening the door, opening a bottle or some other external object.</p> <p>Now, that's my take on this, and you can ignore it if you want to, but we'll get on to some more of these subtleties which are not disputed by anybody as we go forward.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/76-the-right-opening-%E3%81%82%E3%81%8F-%E3%81%82%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B-%E3%81%B2%E3%82%89%E3%81%8F-%E3%81%B2%E3%82%89%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B-%E9%96%8B%E3%81%8F-%E9%96%8B%E3%81%91/#_1","title":"\u958b\u304f (\u3072\u3089\u304f &amp; \u3042\u304f)","text":"<p>So now let's look at the difference between <code>\u3042\u304f</code> and <code>\u3072\u3089\u304f</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>They both mean <code>open</code>. <code>\u3042\u304f</code> is officially speaking self-move, although we can see that there's a little bit of leeway here; <code>\u3072\u3089\u304f</code> is both self-move and other-move quite formally.</p> <p>The difference between them has nothing to do with self-move or other-move.

Simple as that.</p> <p>What the \u304c-particle does is, it marks the subject of the sentence,</p> <p>that's to say, the thing that we're saying something about.</p> <p>We're either saying <code>A is B</code> or <code>A does B</code>.</p> <p>What the A-car is is the subject of the sentence, the be-er or the do-er of the sentence.</p> <p>The \u304c-particle marks this. It can never mark anything else.</p> <p>But conventional Japanese makes a mess of this by misunderstanding some Japanese sentences to the point where it has to say that \u304c only sometimes marks the subject of the sentence; other times it marks the object. Now, this is nonsense and I've demonstrated that it's nonsense.</p> <p>\u304c never marks anything but the subject.</p> <p>Tae Kim tries to reconcile this problem by saying that \u304c doesn't mark the subject</p> <p>and even going so far as to say that there is no such thing as a subject in Japanese</p> <p>and saying that there is a subject is simply imposing European concepts on the language.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, the truth is that every human language has a subject, which is what we call an A-car,</p> <p>and a predicate, which is what we call a B-engine.</p> <p>All we are saying when we say this is that every human language can say something about something.</p> <p>It can take a particular thing and say a particular thing about it.</p> <p>The particular thing it takes is called the <code>subject</code>.</p> <p>The particular thing it says about it is the predicate (=basically everything excluding the subject).</p> <p>It's as simple as that.</p> <p>If we don't have subjects and predicates we don't have language in any developed sense of the word.</p> <p>All we can do, if we can't say a particular thing about a particular thing, is make noises</p> <p>that express that we're happy or sad or angry or frightened, just as animals do.</p> <p>Without subjects and predicates there is no language. Simple as that.</p> <p>Different languages may deal with them in very different ways, but the concepts have to be there.</p> <p>Now, what is it that induces Tae Kim-sensei to declare that Japanese is so different</p> <p>from any human language that it has no subject?</p> <p>Well, ironically, it's the fact that he can't shake the Eihongo grammar approach</p> <p>that continually imposes English structure on Japanese.</p> <p>It's because they can't conceive (and apparently Tae Kim-sensei can't conceive either)</p> <p>that the Japanese could ever take the ego out of the heart of a subjective sentence.</p> <p>So, the example he uses to <code>prove</code> that Japanese has no subject is the phrase</p> <p><code>\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u304c\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044</code>,</p> <p>which of course in all the textbooks gets translated as <code>I want to eat crepes</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>::: info Tae Kim-sensei\u2019s explanation. ::: And, as usual in English, the experiencer of the subjectivity, the ego, is placed at the center.</p> <p>That's the subject, that's the doer: <code>I want to eat crepes.</code></p> <p>And of course the crepes are marked by \u304c, and they're not the subject, are they?</p> <p>So \u304c isn't marking the subject. On this, Tae Kim-sensei and conventional Eihongo Japanese are at one.</p> <p>Eihongo Japanese explains it by saying that \u304c only sometimes marks the subject.</p> <p>Tae Kim-sensei explains it by saying that there is no subject in the entire language.</p> <p>But the simple reason for both these statements is a complete inability</p> <p>to even consider the fact that Japanese might use different expressions from English</p> <p>and that it could be possible to take the ego out of the center of a statement about subjectivity.</p> <p>Now, the odd thing about this is we don't even have to go as far as Japanese</p> <p>to know that this happens all the time. It happens in Spanish.</p> <p><code>Me gusta el Tequila</code> is not saying <code>I like Tequila</code>, although all the textbooks will tell you it is.</p> <p>It's saying <code>Tequila does pleasing to me</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, this may not be the way English wants to put it, but it is the way Spanish puts it.</p> <p><code>\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u304c\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044</code> means <code>Crepes are eat want-inducing (to me)</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Again, this may not be the way English wants to put it, but it is the way Japanese puts it.</p> <p>The \u304c-particle is doing what it always does.</p> <p>It's marking the subject, the doer, the A-car, of the sentence.</p> <p>It's just that the subject, the doer, the A-car, of the sentence in Japanese is not the same as</p> <p>it would be if an English person tried to express the same sentiment.</p> <p></p> <p>The subject of the sentence is the crepes.</p> <p>They are the one that's doing the eat want-inducing to the experiencer.</p> <p>And if we understand this we don't have to say that \u304c marks the subject some of the time.</p> <p>We can see that \u304c marks the subject all the time.</p> <p>And we don't have to start saying that there's no such thing as a subject in Japanese.</p> <p>Because the only language in which there's no such thing as a subject</p> <p>is <code>wanwan</code> and <code>nyan-nyan</code> language. ::: info Since I was not able to find anything about them, I am pretty sure it was a joke (\uffe3\u25a1\uffe3\u300d) ::: Human language has to have subjects and predicates or it ceases to be language.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/77-real-japanese-structure-vs-tae-kim-structural-review-of-tae-kim-s-japanese-grammar/#the-metaphysical-trap","title":"The Metaphysical Trap","text":"<p>Now, some of you may be asking, how can I say that my model is the truth?</p> <p></p> <p>::: info And yes, Linguistics is in fact a scientific field too. ::: That the whole of conventional Japanese grammar is not true and Tae Kim-sensei,</p> <p>whom I acknowledge to be a very fine mind, is also producing models that aren't true?</p> <p>And the answer to that is, I'm not saying that at all.</p> <p>There is no such thing as truth in language structure or linguistics,</p> <p>just as there is no such thing as truth in science.</p> <p>Humans have metaphysical minds.</p> <p>They want narratives and they want truth and falsehood.</p> <p>Both of these are inherited from deep and ancient metaphysical intuitions.</p> <p>And I'm not saying anything here about whether those intuitions are true or whether they're false.</p> <p>All I'm saying is, if they're true, neither science nor linguistics are the places to look for them.</p> <p>If we have a model that is inconsistent and has to be continually shoehorned with rules</p> <p>and exceptions to make it work, or we have a model that is too vague to be very useful,</p> <p>and then we have a model that is precise and consistent and works all the time,</p> <p>we're likely to say that that third model is the true one.</p> <p>But in fact this is falling into the metaphysical trap.</p> <p>I may occasionally speak that way myself, but let's be perfectly clear:</p> <p>this is just really a trick of language.</p> <p>When compared to the inconsistent model or the vague model,</p> <p>the consistent and accurately predictive model is not <code>truer</code>, but it is more useful.</p> <p>Science doesn't tell us truth. It predicts things.</p> <p>It tells us that when we do A and B the result is going to be C.</p> <p>This has nothing to do with truth, metaphysics, narratives or anything else,</p> <p>it's just a method of prediction.</p> <p>And if we can predict things, we can do useful things with those predictions.</p> <p>It's exactly the same with language.</p> <p>So the conventional model is sufficiently inconsistent that in many cases it's not fit for purpose,</p> <p>at least not if we can find a better model to replace it with.</p> <p>Tae Kim-sensei's answer to this is to create a model so vague that it's unfalsifiable.</p> <p>Now, when we talk about models or theories, being falsifiable may sound like a negative, but it's not.</p> <p>It's a positive.</p> <p></p> <p>Because if there are no circumstances under which a theory can be falsified,</p> <p>then essentially it doesn't really mean anything.</p> <p>Theories work by defining phenomena; that's to say, setting out their limits:</p> <p>setting out the conditions under which they apply and the conditions under which they don't apply.</p> <p>If we create one that applies under all possible conditions, then it really doesn't mean anything.</p> <p>If you give me an object and ask me what it is, if I say it's a marble, or it's a box, or it's a twig,</p> <p>you can verify or falsify that statement.</p> <p>If I say it's an object, you can't falsify it, because everything is an object,</p> <p>but on the other hand, I haven't told you anything worth knowing.</p> <p>::: info This above portion was really good. It shows that linguistics is not merely black and white, there are not only <code>right</code> and <code>wrong</code> ideas - rather, <code>more useful</code> and <code>less useful</code> ideas for a PARTICULAR individual. For some, Tae Kim-sensei\u2019s explanation works way better than Dolly\u2019s, and that is okay\u2026if a person keeps going with the studies/exposure, they will eventually understand how the language truly works even if at first they were told conflicting info - due to how our brains restructure around and solve language problems by natural patterns, logic etc. :::</p> <p>What Tae Kim does with the \u304c-particle is call it the <code>identifier particle</code>.</p> <p>Now, if you went a bit further, that might be useful.</p> <p>Does it identify the subject? Does it identify the object?</p> <p>Does it identify some completely different kind of category?</p> <p>And the answer is, we're not told.</p> <p>All Tae Kim-sensei has to tell us is that it indicates that the speaker wants to identify something unspecified.</p> <p>Now, this vagueness might be considered not very destructive, but in fact it is very destructive</p> <p>because it essentially takes away our ability to define anything.</p> <p></p> <p>We can't see how the core Japanese sentence works because we don't have the \u304c-particle.</p> <p>We can't talk about the difference between logical and non-logical particles (Lesson 8b),</p> <p>like the \u306f and \u3082 topic markers, because we don't have the key logical particle.</p> <p>If we have to build a theory around this undefined \u304c,</p> <p>then we're going to have a very undefined kind of theory.</p> <p>So we've essentially created a structure that negates the core structure of Japanese from the beginning.</p> <p>And once we've done that, we logically find ourselves having to do other things</p> <p>that take the theory even further from being useful and predictive.</p> <p>So in our next lesson (Lesson 78) we're going to look at</p> <p>what happened to the <code>\u3060</code> copula in Tae Kim-sensei's theory and some other consequences.</p> <p>Now, once again, I'm not trying to denigrate Tae Kim-sensei.</p> <p>In fact, the reason I've singled him out is because</p> <p>he's the only person who's really challenged the conventional Eihongo model</p> <p>at a deep enough level to give us another perspective, another angle for assessing Japanese structure.</p> <p>And it's really only because he's that important and that intelligent</p> <p>that I made the difficult decision to make this video and the next one.</p> <p>::: info To reiterate, this is NOT Dolly putting down Tae-Kim-sensei or saying her way is superior, because language is not black and white... It just compares Dolly\u2019s understanding to Tae-Kim\u2019s. And it is completely okay to have different kinds of mindsets about things in language. This happens all the time in linguistics.

Looks more like a teddy bear in a rabbit suit to me!</code></p> <p>And in all these cases we know, everybody knows, that the sentences aren't fully grammatical.</p> <p>You have to say, <code>I got up early this morning</code>, <code>Do you fancy a cup of coffee?</code>,</p> <p><code>Do you call that a rabbit? It looks more like a teddy bear in a rabbit suit to me!</code></p> <p>This is perfectly natural. All languages drop necessary grammatical elements</p> <p>when they can be readily understood by the [listener] in very casual speech.</p> <p>You can't do it in an essay or in formal writing or in a legal document</p> <p>or anything like that, but you can do it in casual speech.</p> <p>In Japanese, not only does the copula get dropped,</p> <p>half the particles can get dropped in very casual speech.</p> <p>And I don't think anybody argues that they aren't necessary.</p> <p>So, in actual grammatical Japanese you can only end a sentence in one of those three ways.</p> <p>It can end with a verb, it can end with an adjective, or it can end with the copula,</p> <p>and the copula always has to be attached to a noun, because that's how the copula works.</p> <p>And as we know, what the copula does is tell us that A is B.</p> <p><code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u304c\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u3060</code> means <code>Sakura is a Japanese person</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>It only works one way around.</p> <p>A Japanese person is not necessarily Sakura.</p> <p>Sakura is a Japanese person.</p> <p>That's what we're being told by a copula sentence.</p> <p>Now, if we look at all the elements in Japanese, all the verbal elements, there aren't very many.</p> <p>Unlike English, unlike European languages, there really are very few.</p> <p></p> <p>There are verbs, adjectives and the copula, and then, aside from that, we have nouns --</p> <p>-- nearly everything that's not a verb or an adjective is a noun.</p> <p>There are also particles, and there are some conjunctions like <code>\u306a\u3089</code> and <code>\u3051\u308c\u3069</code>.</p> <p>Almost everything else that isn't a verb or an adjective is in fact a noun.</p> <p>There are a few exceptions but not very many.</p> <p>Now, why are we dividing them up in this way?</p> <p>On the one side we have verbs, adjectives and the copula;</p> <p>on the other side we have nouns, particles and conjunctions.</p> <p>The reason is that when we split them up this way,</p> <p>apart from the fact that we have the three engines together,</p> <p>the three engines have another characteristic, another quality.</p> <p>They are all <code>\u7528\u8a00</code>, they are all transforming verbal elements,</p> <p>that's to say, they can all change grammatically.</p> <p>::: info Dolly does not give the Kanji form of \u300c\u3088\u3046\u3052\u3093\u300dbut I am practically sure it is this one. ::: They don't change as much as conventional Japanese or Tae Kim-sensei</p> <p>would have us believe. They don't conjugate.</p> <p>But they do change the last kana (in a couple of cases a little more than the last kana)</p> <p>and then, in the case of verbs and adjectives,</p> <p>they can attach helper verbs, helper adjectives, and helper nouns.</p> <p>And this is a fundamental basis of the way Japanese works.</p> <p>In the other column we have nouns, particles and conjunctions, and these never change.</p> <p>A noun never changes grammatically.</p> <p>It never has any kind of transformation or modification made for grammatical purposes.</p> <p>Particles never change. They attach to nouns but they always stay the same.</p> <p>Conjunctions, like <code>\u304b\u3089</code> and <code>\u3051\u308c\u3069</code>, don't change their form for grammatical purposes.</p> <p>The only verbal elements that do that in Japanese are the three engines:</p> <p>verbs, adjectives and the copula.</p> <p>But if you look at the conventional Japanese grammar textbooks and websites</p> <p>you don't end up knowing, for the most part,</p> <p>that the copula is one of these grammatically transforming elements.</p> <p>We know that the verbs are.

In that case the equals sign works both ways.</p> <p>So, for example, if I say <code>That person over there is Sakura</code>,</p> <p>well, that particular person over there and Sakura are the same person.</p> <p>Sakura is a set of one to which that person over there, and that person over there only, belongs.</p> <p>At least, this particular Sakura. We're not talking about all people called Sakura, obviously.</p> <p>So this is what the copula does. Why so much confusion about it?</p> <p>Isn't it a relatively simple function? Well yes, it is a simple function.</p> <p>The main problem here, as very often with Western misconceptions of Japanese,</p> <p>lies not in Japanese but in the nature of the English language itself.</p> <p>English, as I said, doesn't have a dedicated copula.</p> <p>It does have a copula. Every language has to have a copula.</p> <p>If we didn't have something that performed the copular function,</p> <p>we just wouldn't be able to put things into sets,</p> <p>which means that we would be very limited in our ability to conceptualize things.</p> <p>So what English does is that it doubles up the verb of being with the copula.</p> <p>The verb of being is something that simply tells us that something exists.</p> <p>It has various forms: <code>is / am / are / was</code> etc.</p> <p></p> <p>So, if we say <code>I am an American</code>, that's the copula at work.</p> <p>We're saying I belong to the set called <code>American people</code>.</p> <p>If we say <code>I think, therefore I am</code>, we're using the verb of being.</p> <p>We're not saying anything about what I am, what set I belong to.</p> <p>We're simply saying that because I think, we can state confidently that I exist.</p> <p>Now, because English does not have two separate words for those two concepts,</p> <p>it doesn't actually cause much trouble to native speakers of English</p> <p>or to foreign speakers who have learned English at least partly through immersion,</p> <p>because after a while it all becomes clear through usage and experience,</p> <p>but it does cause trouble when English tries to look at languages that have a separate copula.</p> <p>Japanese obviously is one of these, and Spanish is another.</p> <p>The Spanish language has two copulas, <code>ser</code> and <code>estar</code>:</p> <p><code>ser</code>, which tells us the permanent set to which something belongs,</p> <p>and <code>estar</code>, which tells us the relatively temporary set to which something belongs.</p> <p>That's a distinction that most languages don't make.

It shows \u201cX is / = this adjectival quality\u201d, e.g. likely why it carries the copular function in itself. This is also why \u3060 is not used with it since it is redundant as the -\u3044 already basically implies it. Dolly explains it that way - carrying a copular function within itself &amp; likely why \u3060 isn\u2019t used.</p> <p>But there are different stances you can check by searching on this issue, some refer to -\u3044 as \u201csort of a copula\u201d, others don\u2019t, some even question whether Japanese has adjectives at all. But overall it does not entirely matter how it is called, what matters is that you understand how it works in the language &amp; how it is used properly. As not all words ending in -\u3044 are an adjective automatically, since there may be a hidden Kanji form etc. Although in 98% it is an adjective.*</p> <p>Basically, Dolly is there to give you the basics, if you go into the depths, things are rarely straightforward &amp; universal. Language is a very complex construct &amp; doesn\u2019t quite work like that. E.g. why there are so many ways to study it, interpret it &amp; explain it. Choose what works for you. :::</p> <p>So what's happening when we put <code>\u3067\u3059</code> at the end of an adjective sentence</p> <p>is that we're doubling the copular.</p> <p>Saying <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059</code> is like saying <code>(Speaking of) Sakura (she) is-cute is</code>.</p> <p>Saying <code>\u30da\u30f3\u304c\u8d64\u3044\u3067\u3059</code> is essentially saying <code>Pen is-red is</code>.</p> <p>We're doubling that copular.</p> <p>So while <code>\u3067\u3059</code> is an empty formality marker, it's not just a random formality marker.</p> <p>It's doing something that is sometimes done in languages, and that is,</p> <p>(it is) acting as a redundancy -- saying the same thing twice.</p> <p>::: info  I understand that since it\u2019s a redundancy, we may say that it\u2019s not a copular that is strictly used to fulfill the copular function of the clause or sentence, but rather its main focus is that it provides this politeness aspect to the copular in -\u3044 so as to show the sentence is polite.  :::</p> <p>It is still a copula by all means, but since -\u3044 has a similar function, it mainly shows politeness.</p> <p>And that's the only actual case where <code>\u3067\u3059</code> does something different from <code>\u3060</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>::: tip  Recommend reading the comments under the video as usual.

The \u306b and \u3078 particles","text":"<p>Lesson 8: Location, purpose and transformation - keys to the ni particle and he particle</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/8-the-%E3%81%AB-and-%E3%81%B8-particles/#the-particle","title":"The \u306b Particle","text":"<p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3002</p> <p>Today we are going to talk about the particle <code>\u306b</code>, and in doing so we are going to level up. What do I mean by that? In the past seven lessons we've learned quite a lot of basic Japanese structure. We can say quite a lot of things now if we have the vocabulary. But everything we can say is very, very concrete.</p> <p>We can talk about doing things and being things, which of course is the core of every sentence. But we also need to have some more sophisticated concepts at our disposal. Things like purpose and intention and transformation. So today we're going to look at uses of the \u306b-particle, some of which are very concrete still and some of which begin to take us into those more sophisticated areas.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, we've already looked at the \u306b-particle, haven't we? And we know that in a logical sentence it marks the ultimate target of an action. So <code>(zero\u304c)\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306b\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u306a\u3052\u305f</code> means <code>I threw the ball at Sakura</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>The ball is marked by \u3092 because it's the thing I actually threw. I am marked by \u304c whether you can see me or not, because I am the one who did the action of throwing. But Sakura is marked by \u306b because she is the target of that action, in this case very literally.</p> <p>Now, the \u306b-particle nearly always marks a target of one kind or another. So, if we are going somewhere or sending something somewhere or putting something somewhere, we use \u306b for that <code>somewhere</code>. So if A is going to B, then B is marked by \u306b. B is the destination, the target of that going.</p> <p>So if I'm going to the park, I say <code>(zero\u304c)\u3053\u3046\u3048\u3093\u306b\u3044\u304f</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>If I'm going to the shops, I say <code>(zero\u304c)\u304a\u307f\u305b\u306b\u3044\u304f</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So the literal, physical destination or target of movement is marked by \u306b. However, we can also mark a subtler kind of target.</p> <p>So we can say <code>(zero\u304c)\u304a\u307f\u305b\u306b\u305f\u307e\u3054\u3092\u304b\u3044\u306b\u3044\u304f</code>. This means <code>I go to the shops to buy eggs</code>.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u304a\u307f\u305b</code> is <code>shop/s</code> \u2013 <code>shop</code> is <code>\u307f\u305b</code> and we put the honorific <code>\u304a</code> on it because we give honor to the people who help us to have all the lovely things that we are lucky enough to have. <code>\u305f\u307e\u3054</code> are eggs \u2013 you might, if you're old enough, remember \u305f\u307e\u3054\u3063\u3061/Tamagotchi, the little egg-person that you raise.</p> <p>And <code>\u304b\u3044</code> is the \u3044-stem of <code>\u304b\u3046</code> \u2013 to buy. The \u3044-stem is a very special stem and it can do lots of things, and it can also just be there on its own.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u304b\u3044\u306b\u3044\u304f</code> means <code>[go] in order to buy, for the purpose of buying</code>.</p> <p>Now, you may be saying, <code>I thought that logical particles like \u306b and \u304c and \u3092 can only mark nouns</code> \u2013 and that's absolutely correct. Because one of the things that the \u3044-stem of a verb can do when it's on its own is turn that verb into the equivalent noun.</p> <p>::: info Refer to Lesson 7.5, the \u3044-stem, converting verbs :::</p> <p>(It can do something else as well, but I can talk about that another day.)</p> <p></p> <p>So <code>\u304b\u3044</code>, the act of buying, is a noun. Just as in English if we say <code>I like swimming</code>, <code>swimming</code> is a noun, swimming is a thing I like, and if we say <code>I go to the shop for the purpose of buying eggs</code>, then that <code>buying</code> is also a noun, it's the thing we're going for. And <code>\u304b\u3044</code> is just like that.</p> <p>So <code>\u304b\u3044</code> is the thing we're going to do and it's a noun and it's marked by \u306b. So, you see that in this sentence we have two targets:</p> <p></p> <p>the shops \u2013 <code>\u304a\u307f\u305b</code> \u2013 is the actual physical target of our going, the place, and buying eggs is the reason for our going, so that's the emotional target, the volitional target, a more subtle kind of target than the physical place we're going to, but still a target. And it's possible to have two targets in the same sentence, both marked by \u306b. And that's exactly what we're doing here.</p> <p>So \u306b gives us the target of an action in the most literal sense and also the volitional target, the actual aim of our action.</p> <p>Now, to get back to more concrete things, \u306b which marks the actual location target of where we're going, of where we're putting something, can also mark the place where a person or a thing IS.</p> <p>So I can say, <code>\u304a\u307f\u305b\u306b\u3044\u304f</code> \u2013 <code>I am going to the shops / I will go to the shops</code> \u2013 and we can say, <code>\u304a\u307f\u305b\u306b\u3044\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>I am at the shops</code>.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u3053\u3046\u3048\u3093\u306b\u3044\u304f</code> \u2013 <code>I'll go to the park</code>; <code>\u3053\u3046\u3048\u3093\u306b\u3044\u308b</code> -<code>I'm at the park</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now you see, this is also a target, because in order for a thing to be anywhere, it must have gotten there at some point. So <code>\u306b</code> can mark not only a future target, a place where I will go to, it can also mark a past target, a place where I went and where I still am.</p> <p>And we also use this for inanimate objects: <code>\u307b\u3093\u306f\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u3046\u3048\u306b\u3042\u308b</code> \u2013 <code>The book is on the table</code>. <code>\u3046\u3048</code> is a noun, and in this case it means the <code>on</code> of the table. <code>\u3046\u3048</code> can mean <code>up</code> or <code>over</code>, in this case it means <code>on</code>, and it's always a noun, so in this case the <code>on of the table</code> is the place where the book is:</p> <p></p> <p>the past target of the book, to which it went and at which it now remains. So \u306b can also mark the place where a thing is, its past target.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/8-the-%E3%81%AB-and-%E3%81%B8-particles/#marking-the-target-of-a-transformation","title":"\u306b marking the target of a transformation","text":"<p>And the last aspect of <code>\u306b</code> that I want to look at is that \u306b can also mark the target of a transformation.</p> <p></p> <p>Just as if A is going to B, \u306b marks B, the place where it's going, if A turns into B, becomes B, then \u306b also marks B, the thing it's becoming, the thing it turns into.</p> <p>So if I say, <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u304b\u3048\u308b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f</code>... <code>\u304b\u3048\u308b</code> is <code>frog</code> and <code>\u306a\u308b</code> is a close cousin of <code>\u3042\u308b</code>: <code>\u3042\u308b</code> means <code>be</code>; <code>\u306a\u308b</code> means <code>become</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So, <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u304b\u3048\u308b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f</code> \u2013 <code>Sakura became a frog / Sakura turned into a frog</code>, and \u306b marks the thing she became, the thing she turned into.</p> <p>Now, you may be thinking, <code>Mmm, how often do people turn into frogs these days?</code> \u2013 and I'll grant that it isn't very often.

Let's say it together.</p> <p>A Japanese sentence can only end with a verb, an adjective, or a noun-plus-copula.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, once we know that, we know why the copula can get left off very easily.</p> <p>As I said before, particles and the copula get left off</p> <p>where it's obvious what the nouns were without marking them. That's when they get left off.</p> <p>Now, if a noun comes at the end of the sentence, we know that it's not a verb sentence.</p> <p>We know that it's not an adjective sentence.</p> <p>We know that it's a noun-plus-copula sentence.</p> <p>And since we know that, we can, if we want to, drop the copula.</p> <p>And this, I think, is why Tae Kim-sensei gets lured into saying that <code>\u3060</code> is a declarative,</p> <p>a sort of verbal exclamation mark.</p> <p>What he's saying is that people use <code>\u3060</code> when they want to stress what they're saying.</p> <p>Well, there's a certain amount of truth in that because the fact is</p> <p>that you can in casual speech always drop the copula and still be understood,</p> <p>so if you're speaking at the kind of casual level where you probably would be dropping it,</p> <p>then when you include it is when you want to stress what you're saying.</p> <p>It's not really as simple as that, because a lot of people don't drop it,</p> <p>not everybody drops it all the time. It's a bit more complex than that,</p> <p>but the idea that it is a declarative at least has that grain of truth in it</p> <p>that because you can drop it pretty much whenever you want to in casual speech,</p> <p>you often include it because you want to stress it.</p> <p>So if it's easy to drop the copula when it's <code>\u3060</code>,</p> <p>why isn't it easy to drop it when it's <code>\u3067\u3059</code>?</p> <p>Tae Kim-sensei turns this into a whole argument</p> <p>for the fact that <code>\u3060</code> and <code>\u3067\u3059</code> are two different things,</p> <p>but if you think about it it's perfectly obvious why <code>\u3060</code> does get dropped</p> <p>(I've explained that already) and why <code>\u3067\u3059</code> doesn't.</p> <p><code>\u3067\u3059</code> doesn't get dropped because it's formal speech.</p> <p>In the first place, we drop less in formal speech.</p> <p></p> <p>We don't drop as many things in a formal sentence as we do in an informal sentence.</p> <p>But even if we're speaking formal speech at a loose level,</p> <p>where we can be dropping things out of the sentence,</p> <p>we won't drop the <code>\u3067\u3059</code>.</p> <p>Why not?</p> <p>Because there's only one thing that makes \u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e (\u3067\u3059/\u307e\u3059 level speech) into \u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e,</p> <p>and that's the fact that we add the <code>\u307e\u3059</code> helper verb to the end of verb sentences</p> <p>and the <code>\u3067\u3059</code> copula to the end of noun-plus-copula sentences</p> <p>and even, redundantly, to the end of adjective sentences.</p> <p>So you can't, in \u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e, drop the <code>\u3067\u3059</code> without dropping the \u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e.</p> <p>It's as simple as that.</p> <p>Now, there are various rules about when you can and can't</p> <p>drop things like \u3092 out of a casual sentence.</p> <p></p> <p>::: info Obviously it\u2019s a joke\u2026just in case (\u30ce*\u00b0\u25bd\u00b0*) ::: You can in theory drop something whenever it isn't needed.</p> <p>In practice there are places where it seems natural</p> <p>and other places where it doesn't seem natural.</p> <p>If you want to know the rules for it, sometimes they're very complex</p> <p>and even when they're very complex they don't necessarily work all the time.</p> <p>But you don't need to know that.</p> <p>Why don't you need to know it?</p> <p>Well, let's think about this.</p> <p>You need to know that they can be dropped and you need to know that</p> <p>they're dropped in places where you can actually work out what they were going to be.</p> <p>Once you know that, you're not swimming in an ocean of strange vagueness</p> <p>where things get dropped and you've no idea what they are.</p> <p>What you don't need is to be able to reproduce very casual Japanese</p> <p>in exactly the way that Japanese people do it.</p> <p>And that's the only reason you'd need to learn these strange lists of rules.</p> <p>If you just use all the particles all the time, occasionally,</p> <p>especially when you're speaking casual Japanese,</p> <p>your Japanese will sound a bit stilted.</p> <p>Well, what about that?</p> <p>Language spoken by foreigners usually does sound a little bit stilted, doesn't it?</p> <p>You've probably noticed that in English.</p> <p>If you're going to be using Japanese a lot, gradually, bit by bit,</p> <p>you'll get used to the places where you can naturally drop things.</p> <p>If you're not going to be using Japanese a lot,</p> <p>why do you want to sit down and learn a bunch of rules</p> <p>in order that you can pretend that you've naturally acquired Japanese</p> <p>when not only haven't you, but you've no intention of doing so?</p> <p>So my advice to you is <code>Learn Japanese naturally</code>.</p> <p>Don't try to memorize sets of rules when all they could possibly do is make you seem</p> <p>as if you're more used to Japanese than you actually are.</p> <p>But in practice they're not even going to do that, because you will make mistakes.</p> <p>The important thing to understand is how things get dropped in Japanese,</p> <p>why they get dropped in Japanese, and</p> <p>how to understand them when they have been dropped.</p> <p>::: info Great advice indeed, Dolly (o\u2267\u25bd\u309c)o

<code>\u3057\u304b</code> sentence.</p> <p><code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3057\u304b\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002</code></p> <p>In natural English we'd translate this as,</p> <p><code>There's nobody here but Sakura.</code></p> <p></p> <p>So what's <code>\u3057\u304b</code> doing here?</p> <p><code>\u3057\u304b</code> does two things in a sentence like this.</p> <p>It knocks out the \u304c-particle just like <code>\u304b</code>,</p> <p>so this isn't something that we're not already familiar with.</p> <p>When you have <code>\u304b</code> in a sentence where there would also be a \u304c,</p> <p>we never say <code>\u304c\u304b</code> or <code>\u304b\u304c</code>.</p> <p><code>\u304b</code> displaces \u304c, but the \u304c is still logically there.</p> <p>That's what <code>\u3057\u304b</code> also does.</p> <p>But the other thing <code>\u3057\u304b</code> does is a little bit more unusual.</p> <p></p> <p>I don't know if you've ever used Photoshop,</p> <p>but in Photoshop you can invert a selection.</p> <p>What happens is that you select an object,</p> <p></p> <p>you press the key selection to invert that selection</p> <p>and what happens is that everything outside of that object is selected.</p> <p></p> <p>The object is the only thing there now that isn't selected.</p> <p>This is exactly what <code>\u3057\u304b</code> does.</p> <p>While \u304c, you might say, selects an object, a noun,</p> <p>and marks it as the A-car, the subject of the sentence,</p> <p><code>\u3057\u304b</code> selects that noun, inverts the selection</p> <p>and marks that as the A-car of the sentence.</p> <p>So everything other than that selected noun</p> <p>is now the A-car of the sentence.</p> <p>So, <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3057\u304b\u3044\u306a\u3044</code> literally means</p> <p><code>Everyone other than Sakura is not here</code>.</p> <p>In the deer sentence, which looks a little more complicated,</p> <p>it's exactly the same thing: <code>\u5948\u826f\u306a\u3089\u9e7f\u3057\u304b\u53f1\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044</code></p> <p>(if it's Nara, everything other than the deer are not scolded).</p> <p></p> <p>So again, we're selecting the deer,</p> <p>inverting the selection to everything other than the deer,</p> <p>and then that becomes the A-car of the sentence, which is <code>not scolded</code>.</p> <p>Now, there's also an implicit relevance clause in this,</p> <p>so when we say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3057\u304b\u3044\u306a\u3044</code> we don't mean there's nothing here but Sakura: no trees, no bushes, no flying saucers.</p> <p>We mean there's nobody here but Sakura.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, the <code>\u3044\u306a\u3044</code> partly tells us that, but it isn't just that,</p> <p>because it also doesn't mean that there are no bunny rabbits here,</p> <p>there are no birds, there are no capybara (did I pronounce that right?)</p> <p></p> <p>::: info It should simply select the relevance that no other Sakura / no other people are there. --- ::: So <code>\u3057\u304b</code> inverts the selection, but it's also*</p> <p>what you might call a <code>smart invert</code>: it selects for

Usually, in terms of NATIVE-derived Japanese grammar linguistics, if something is called as x, it is linguistically viable to use it for description of the language, but some models have their own systems that either agree with them or not, for various reasons. Just like Dolly says below, these models are there to just describe the language in some coherent chunk while finding some common ground, but they may differ in some instances. It is up to you which model you will use, eventually you should achieve fluency either way once you don\u2019t need explanations and terminologies anymore and you have the language automatised, but it helps studying the general consensus in most (esp. native) linguistic models.</p> <p> :::</p> <p>As I've said before, grammar, structure, models, whatever you want to call them,</p> <p>are not the source code of language.

The same is true in English.</p> <p>If we say <code>I am American</code>, we actually don't need the <code>I</code>, because <code>am</code> implies <code>I</code>.</p> <p>We don't use <code>am</code> with anything other than <code>I</code>, so the <code>I</code> is redundant.</p> <p>It's just that English doesn't permit you to drop it.

In fact, it doesn't have any conjugations at all, despite what the textbooks say.</p> <p>In Japanese the null subject is determined entirely from context.</p> <p>And when context doesn't make it clear, it generally defaults to <code>I</code>.</p> <p>This is almost exactly what English <code>it</code> does, except that <code>it</code> in English isn't zeroed.</p> <p></p> <p>So if I say <code>It fell from the sky / It ate my breakfast / It's half the size of the other one</code>,</p> <p>you have no idea what <code>it</code> is unless context supplies the answer.

How they REALLY work.</p> <p>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f.</p> <p>Today we're going to get the key to every Japanese sentence. We're going to do a round-up of the logical particles \u2013 and the logical particles are the linchpins of Japanese. With a full understanding of what they do you can understand every Japanese sentence. Without it, you can't. </p> <p>And that's why the Japanese taught by the textbook which doesn't explain the logical particles correctly leaves most learners non-functional in Japanese even after they've passed exams. So, I'm going to do a round-up of the logical particles we've learned so far and I'm going to introduce the last major logical particle, which is the \u3067-particle. </p> <p>I'm going to do this with an analogy of detective work, because the logical particles essentially interrogate the nouns in the sentence and show how they relate to each other and to the verb of the sentence, and they give the structure of the sentence.</p> <p></p> <p>And this is what a logical particle is. People sometimes ask <code>What do you mean by a logical particle?</code></p> <p></p> <p>We've already discussed the difference between a logical particle and a non-logical topic-marker. A logical particle tells us how the sentence logically holds together. It tells us who does what to whom, with what, where, when and so forth. The \u306f-particle doesn't do this, it just tells us what is the topic we're speaking about.</p> <p>There are other particles that I would call a-logical. They're not non-logical topic markers, but they're not logical particles either. For example, the particle -\u3068 adds two nouns together. So if we say <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3068\u30e1\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3044\u3066\u3044\u305f</code>, we're saying <code>Sakura and Mary were walking</code>. The \u304c-particle tells us who was doing the walking. The \u3068-particle simply adds those two together. It doesn't tell us anything about what they were doing, where they were going, or anything else. </p> <p></p> <p>So, the logical particles are the ones that tell us what is actually happening in the sentence. The other thing to remember about logical particles is that they always attach to a noun. If you see a logical particle attaching to anything, you know that that word is in fact functionally a noun. And we must always see the noun plus the particle attaching to it as an inseparable pair. The two work together.</p> <p></p> <p>They are a question and an answer which form a fundamental unit of a Japanese sentence. All right. So let's look at this.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/8b-particles-explained/#particle","title":"Particle \u304c","text":"<p>The head of the Logical Particle Detective Agency is Detective \u304c. </p> <p></p> <p>He is the Chief.

He also has powers that the other logical particles do not have. He can work in A-is-B sentences, that is, descriptive sentences, sentences that tell us what something is, what its qualities are.</p> <p>The other particles can't do that. They can only work in A-does-B sentences, that is, sentences with a verb engine. To put it another way, while Detective Ga works in the office with descriptive work, the other detectives only work on cases, on actual actions, on incidents, on verb-ending clauses. So, let's look at them all at work on a verb-ending clause. Each of them has its own specific questions. Detective \u304c asks the fundamental question: <code>Who did it?</code></p> <p>This is the fundamental question of any sentence, and for that reason, only Detective \u304c's carriage can be black. </p> <p></p> <p>Because the core of every sentence is <code>who did the action?</code> So \u304c asks, <code>Who was the actor?

It has to be some kind of <code>ego</code> actor. </p> <p>::: info Dolly seems to refer to Subject as the Actor sometimes and uses them interchangeably it seems, so just keep that in mind that by Actor she SHOULD mean Subject. This use may become confusing later in the Passive/Receptive if you know some basic linguistics\u2026 but maybe just a <code>me</code> problem\u2026 :::</p> <p>Japanese doesn't work like that at all. It's very happy to have non-sentient beings as the main actor of a sentence. You might call this a more animist way of looking at language. Now, this may sound rather abstract, but it's not abstract at all. Let's get into some concrete examples. I'm going to begin with my favorite example, and if you've heard it before, don't go away because we're going much deeper this time. </p> <p>My favorite example is: <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u304c\u3059\u304d\u3060.</code> Now, we can have the <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057</code> or we can not have it (or rather do not need to have it); it will be understood whether we say it or not.</p> <p></p> <p>What the textbooks and the schools and everybody else tells you is that this means <code>I like coffee</code>. And <code>I like coffee</code> may well be what we would say in English if we wanted to say something similar, but it's not what this sentence means. And if you've followed the course up to this point, you can see why it isn't.</p> <p>The first and most important point here is \u2013 look where the \u304c is. The \u304c is marking the coffee. We know that the main actor (Subject in Active voice), the doer or the be-er of a sentence, is always marked by \u304c, so we know that the main actor of this sentence is not <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057</code> \u2013<code>I</code>, it is the coffee, which is marked by \u304c.</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u308f\u305f\u3057</code> could have an invisible \u304c after it, but in this case it can't, because we already know what the \u304c is, it's the coffee. So the coffee is being or doing something. In English we are told that it is an <code>A does B</code> sentence, but we only have to look at it to see that it isn't. It ends with <code>\u3060</code> \u2013 it's an <code>A is B</code> sentence, isn't it?</p> <p></p> <p>The coffee is <code>\u3059\u304d</code>. So, what does <code>\u3059\u304d</code> mean? <code>\u3059\u304d</code> is a noun, and it's one of those adjectival nouns that we've talked about before. So it's telling us something about the nature or condition of the coffee. In this case, what it's telling us is that the coffee is pleasing. That's the core of the sentence: <code>Coffee is pleasing.</code></p> <p></p> <p>The <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f</code>, implicit or explicit, is telling us in whose case it is pleasing: <code>As for me, coffee is pleasing.</code> Now, this is very very very important. Because if we don't know that, if we really believe that this sentence means <code>I like coffee</code>, our grasp of \u304c and \u3092 is completely messed up.</p> <p>If the actor of this sentence was <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057</code>, it would have to be marked by \u304c. If the thing that the actor was acting upon, by liking it, was the coffee, then it would have to be marked by \u3092. So we have two particles, and two most fundamental particles, completely confused in our mind. We now believe that sometimes \u304c can mark the object of the sentence instead of the subject, the thing acted upon instead of the be-er or doer of the sentence. And we now believe that the object of the sentence, the thing being acted on, can sometimes be marked by \u304c instead of \u3092. And none of this is true. It never can. That can never happen. And if that could happen, Japanese would become chaos. And that's exactly what it does become in the minds of many students.</p> <p>So, as we see in this sentence, <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057</code> is the non-logical topic of the sentence. It's marked by \u306f. It's not the actor. It's not the subject. <code>\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc</code> is not the object, which would be marked by \u3092 if it was. It is the subject. And <code>\u3059\u304d</code> is not a verb meaning <code>to like</code>; it's an adjective meaning <code>to be pleasing</code>.</p> <p>So every single word in this sentence is being misdescribed by the standard explanation. And this kind of misunderstanding throws Japanese into complete chaos. Now, are there many cases like this in Japanese?</p> <p>Well, frankly, it doesn't matter if there are many or not. Once your understanding of the particles is messed up, it's messed up. But as it happens there are a lot. All kinds of different sentence structures in Japanese throw up this same misunderstanding.</p> <p>For example, if we say <code>\u307b\u3093\u304c\u308f\u304b\u308b</code>, or <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u307b\u3093\u304c\u308f\u304b\u308b</code>, we're saying the book is understandable, but the English texts tell you that this means <code>I understand the book</code>, and in this case it's even less forgivable, because there isn't really an equivalent to <code>\u3059\u304d</code> in English, but there is an equivalent to <code>\u308f\u304b\u308b</code>. It means <code>understandable</code> or <code>clear</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>We could say <code>In relation to me, or just to me, the book is understandable</code>, and then we wouldn't be completely messing up what \u304c does or thinking that a noun that should be marked by \u3092 can be marked by \u304c, at random.</p> <p>So why, at least in this case, don't the schools and textbooks simply translate it as it really is? <code>To me, the book is understandable / Speaking of me the book is understandable.</code> Because this prejudice for putting an ego at the center of every sentence is so strong that it takes precedence over learning Japanese correctly. And these are not just a few random cases.</p> <p>Later on, we're going to look at the potential form (lesson 10) and we're going to look at the receptive form (lesson 13), which is misdescribed as passive, and both of them are going to throw up forms of this same problem. Since they are both fairly large subjects in themselves, I'm not going to talk about them now. But let's talk about the way we desire things in Japanese. Let's talk about how Japanese handles desire. Whether we want something or want to do something, how do we talk about this in Japanese?</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/9-the-subject-of-the-japanese-sentence-expressing-desire-%E3%81%BB%E3%81%97%E3%81%84-%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84-%E3%81%9F%E3%81%8C%E3%82%8B/#expressing-desire-with","title":"Expressing desire with \u307b\u3057\u3044","text":"<p>Well, suppose we want something.

And the second thing you can see, which is the most important, is that the \u304c-marked actor of this sentence is not me, who wants the cat.

And we're confused between the verbs and adjectives.

In Japanese we express wanting to do something differently from the way we express wanting to have something. And the way we do it is by using the \u3044-stem again. The \u3044-stem, as I told you before, is a very important stem. So in order to say we want something we have to add the want-adjective, which is <code>\u305f\u3044</code>. So we now have an adjective.</p> <p></p> <p>And what does this adjective mean? It doesn't mean <code>want</code> in the English sense. It can't, because <code>want</code> is a verb and <code>\u305f\u3044</code>, ending in <code>\u3044</code>, is an adjective, isn't it? So let's take an example. This is a slightly notorious example.</p> <p><code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u304c\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, the standard English translation of this is <code>I want to eat crepes</code>. But, as you see, the pattern here is just the same as in the other cases we've been considering. The \u304c-marked actor is not <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057</code>, it's not <code>me</code>, it's the crepes. The desirability of the crepes is not a verb, it's an adjective. And we need to understand this because if we don't it's not just going to mess up this kind of sentence \u2013 it's going to mess up our whole grasp of Japanese words, Japanese particles and Japanese structure.</p> <p>Now, there's no really good way of translating this into English. We would have to say something like <code>In relation to me, crepes are desire-inducing</code>. And that's very awkward.  ::: info it is okay to use <code>want/wanting</code> as a translation. Just remember that \u305f\u3044 is not a verb as <code>want</code> is in English, but is rather an adjective. Translations don\u2019t matter, understanding does. ::: And sometimes people ask me, \"Am I really supposed to use all these awkward literal translations that you give, rather than using natural English?\" And the answer to that is <code>No</code>. You're not supposed to be thinking in terms of my awkward explanations or thinking in terms of natural English. You're supposed to be thinking of Japanese in terms of \u2013 guess what \u2013 Japanese. I'm explaining it in English to give you a start toward doing that. But these unnatural translations or explanations are there to help you grasp the structure of Japanese, not to give you a way of translating Japanese. </p> <p>Now, as I say, the pattern is the same in all these cases, and I don't think it's very difficult to grasp. But now we're going to look at something which could seems a little confusing, and I promise you it isn't, if you just follow carefully what I'm going to say. We have this sentence here: <code>\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u304c\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044</code> but what if we didn't have the crepes here? What if we just said <code>(zero\u304c)\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044</code>? Now there's no longer in this sentence what English wants to call the object of desire, what is in fact the subject of desire, the desire-inducer, and obviously there has to be a \u304c-marked zero-car or, as you know, we don't have a sentence. But what is that zero-car in this case?</p> <p>Well, the ironic thing is that in this case the zero-car is what the English textbooks thought it was all along. It's <code>I</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>I really am the actor of the sentence this time, and that may be part of the reason for a lot of the confusion that happens on this subject. <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057\u304c\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044</code> means <code>I want to eat</code> \u2013 I don't want to eat crepes necessarily or Sakura's obento necessarily, I just want to eat. (I eat-wanting-am) And because there is no eat-inducing subject here, the want-to-eat is attributed directly to me. </p> <p>And you may be asking \u2013 you should be asking \u2013 \"So, what is this -\u305f\u3044? Is it an adjective describing the condition of something making you want to do something, or is it an adjective describing my desire?\" And the answer is that it can be either. Obviously when it is describing a cake it's also indirectly describing my feelings about the cake, it's describing the feelings the cake induces in me. And when there's no cake there, or no crepe here, or no Sakura's obento there, we just describe my feelings directly. And this is often the case in Japanese with adjectives of desire. For example, <code>\u3053\u308f\u3044</code>, which means either <code>scared</code> or <code>scary</code>. If I say, <code>\u304a\u3070\u3051\u304c\u3053\u308f\u3044</code>, I'm saying, <code>Ghosts are scary</code>, but if I say just <code>\u3053\u308f\u3044</code>, I'm saying, <code>I am scared</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, is this confusing? It isn't confusing because we have a landmark that tells us what to do every time. And that landmark is \u304c. In these sentences and in much much more complicated sentences, if we watch the \u304c and watch the other logical particles, we'll never go wrong, because the logical particles never ever ever change their function. So we can use them as our compass. And that's why it's so very destructive to induce people to believe they can change their function as the textbooks do. </p> <p>If you have a compass and I say to you, \"Ah, well, most of the time the compass points north, but sometimes points south and actually quite a lot of the time it also points east\", you might as well not have a compass. I have destroyed the value of your compass for you. And it's the same with the logical particles. They are absolutely reliable. They always point north. (Or I guess, they always point to where they should point, one way) They never change their function.</p> <p></p> <p>So, if \u304c marks the crepes then we know that the subject of the sentence, the thing about which the engine is telling us, is the crepes, nothing else. But if we don't have the \u304c-marked subject there, we know that by default the zero-pronoun is usually <code>I</code> unless there's a reason to think it's something else. It's just the same as in the eel example that we gave in the lesson on \u306f. </p> <p>Now, I'm going to tell you one more thing, and I hope I'm not overloading you with information in this lesson, but it will have the advantage of giving you even more confidence about what the zero pronoun is in these cases. And that is that you cannot use these adjectives of desire, of feeling, about anyone but yourself.</p> <p></p> <p>So if I say <code>\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044</code> and there is nothing to \u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044 in the sentence or the context then I must be talking about me, I can't be talking about you and I can't be talking about Sakura. Why not? Because Japanese doesn't permit us to do that. You can't use <code>-\u305f\u3044</code> about someone else, or <code>\u3053\u308f\u3044</code> or <code>\u307b\u3057\u3044</code> \u2013 we can't use any of these things about someone else.</p> <p>What if we want to say that someone else wants something? Well, because Japanese is a very logical language, it does not allow us to make definite statements about something we can't know for sure, so you see it's very different from Western languages. One thing we can't know for sure is someone else's inner feelings. </p> <p>So I might think that Sakura wants to eat cake, but I don't know that. All I know is how she's acting, I know what she says, I know what she does, I know how she looks, but I don't know what her inner feelings are.</p> <p>::: info Note the word statement here, \u305f\u3044 cannot be used when <code>exhibiting actual knowledge of someone else's subjectivity</code> as Dolly puts in the comments, recommend reading that :::</p> <p>So if I want to talk about her desire to eat cake, I can't use <code>-\u305f\u3044</code>. And I can't use <code>\u3053\u308f\u3044</code> to describe her fear, and I can't use <code>\u307b\u3057\u3044</code> to describe a thing she might want.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/9-the-subject-of-the-japanese-sentence-expressing-desire-%E3%81%BB%E3%81%97%E3%81%84-%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84-%E3%81%9F%E3%81%8C%E3%82%8B/#expressing-statements-of-desire-about-other-people-with","title":"Expressing statements of desire about other people with \u305f\u304c\u308b","text":"<p>So what do I do? I have to add to the adjective of desire a helper verb. I take the <code>\u3044</code> off the \u3044-adjective and I add the helper verb <code>\u304c\u308b</code>. And <code>\u304c\u308b</code> means <code>to show signs of / to look as if it is the case</code>. So if I say, <code>\u3055\u304f\u3089\u304c\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u307b\u3057\u304c\u308b</code> then I'm saying Sakura is showing signs of wanting cake. That's what I'm literally saying.</p> <p></p> <p>And even if she's actually told me she wants cake, that's still what I say, because I can't feel her feelings. I only know what she's doing and saying. </p> <p>Now, why do we use a verb in the case of other people when it's an adjective in the case of ourselves? Again, this is very logical. I can't describe someone else's feelings because I can't feel them. I don't know about them. I can only speak of their actions, and their actions obviously must be a verb. So this is a useful thing to know, but it also helps us to be very clear when we say <code>\u305f\u3079\u305f\u3044</code> or anything else -\u305f\u3044, or anything <code>\u307b\u3057\u3044</code>, that if there is not a cause of that emotion, then the zero pronoun must be me, <code>\u308f\u305f\u3057</code>, because it can't be anybody else.

then we get expressions which I think most of you will have heard</p> <p>at some time and are perhaps a little more confusing.</p> <p>So, <code>\u590f\u306f\u30a2\u30a4\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30a4\u30e0\u306b\u9650\u308b</code> -- now, loosely in English that means</p> <p><code>In summer, ice cream is the best thing</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>What we're actually saying is <code>Speaking of summer, when it comes to summer, it reaches its limit at ice cream</code>,</p> <p>in other words, ice cream is the furthest you can take summer /</p> <p>ice cream is the pinnacle of summer / there's nothing beyond ice cream when we're talking about summer.</p> <p>::: info Of course, this is just a natural Eng translation, hence why it is hard to pin-point \u9650\u308b here. :::</p> <p>And this can be used in all kinds of different expressions, for example:</p> <p><code>\u904b\u52d5\u306a\u3089\u6c34\u6cf3\u306b\u9650\u308b</code> (if it's

I mean, I acquired the vast majority of English through the Internet, books etc., not in school and it is the reason I became fluent in English, with school only this would be almost impossible. Granted, school was useful for acquiring the basics which enabled me to consume stuff. Of course, Europeans acquire English easier than the Japanese, but this still stands I believe. Surrounding yourself in the language as much as possible means you will be able to acquire it faster, hence why immersion in especially foreign countries works so well if you try to slowly understand all that foreign language around you (and studying it) and by slowly utilising it.

be confusing for two reasons.</p> <p>One is that the apparent etymology,</p> <p>the apparent base of the word is very obvious but it's completely misleading.</p> <p>And the other is that because of the way it's used,</p> <p>it's often a bit unclear about which way it's pointing</p> <p>and what it's actually doing.</p> <p>However, once we get clear about this, it's very, very easy to understand.</p> <p>The expression is <code>\u304f\u305b\u306b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, the etymological problem is that</p> <p>whereas we all know what <code>\u304f\u305b / \u7656</code> means</p> <p>-- it means a <code>habit or idiosyncrasy</code> --</p> <p>but it's not very clear what that has to do with the expression <code>\u304f\u305b\u306b</code>.</p> <p>And the answer is: nothing.</p> <p>Some Japanese etymological sources tell us that</p> <p>this <code>\u304f\u305b</code> was actually a different <code>\u304f\u305b</code> originally,</p> <p>but nobody really seems to know for sure.</p> <p>But the point is that it really</p> <p>has very little to do with the modern usage.</p> <p>All we really need to know is that <code>\u304f\u305b\u306b</code></p> <p>is a contrastive conjunction like <code>\u306e\u306b</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, I've done a video about <code>\u306e\u306b</code> and I'll put a link here,</p> <p>but I'm going to assume that you basically know what

<code>\u3051\u308c\u3069</code>.</p> <p>They join two clauses in a manner that means</p> <p><code>despite Clause A, Clause B / even though Clause A, Clause B</code>.</p> <p>Now, <code>\u304f\u305b\u306b</code> has two things in common with <code>\u306e\u306b</code>.</p> <p>One is that it's generally negative in its implications,</p> <p>and the other is that the second clause

<p>but it has most of the time a very specific kind of negative implication.</p> <p></p> <p>And this special usage is essentially</p> <p>taking the nature or character or position of a person</p> <p>and then contrasting their actions with it in a way</p> <p>that is highly unfavorable,</p> <p>so we could use <code>\u306e\u306b</code> in these situations,</p> <p>but <code>\u306e\u306b</code> would sound more regretful.</p> <p><code>\u304f\u305b\u306b</code> sounds much more forceful.</p> <p>It often sounds like severe criticism.</p> <p></p> <p>And, as we say, it's making this kind of contrast,</p> <p>the contrast between what we expect of a certain type</p> <p>and what they actually do, and it's a negative contrast.</p> <p>So, for example, we might say, <code>\u304a\u91d1\u6301\u3061\u306e\u304f\u305b\u306b\u30b1\u30c1\u3060</code></p> <p>(despite the fact that she's well off / she's rich, she's stingy).</p> <p></p>

<p><code>\u7537\u306e\u304f\u305b\u306b\u6ce3\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b</code></p> <p>(despite the fact that he's a man, he's crying).</p> <p>And these are generally intended in an offensive manner.</p> <p>They're intended to register harsh criticism.</p> <p>So we're taking the position of the person</p> <p>and what we expect of that kind of person</p> <p>and then saying something that's in contrast to it.</p> <p></p> <p>But very often we also leave that out.</p> <p>So, for example, suppose some bad people or monsters break into the house</p> <p>and the heroine confronts them and the hero is cowering in a corner.</p> <p>The heroine might just say, <code>\u7537\u306e\u304f\u305b\u306b</code>, which literally means</p> <p><code>Despite the fact that you're a man</code></p> <p>but doesn't then say anything about it.</p> <p></p> <p>In English probably a non-structural but natural translation would be</p> <p><code>And you're supposed to be a man</code>.</p> <p>And this can cause confusion because</p> <p>it can lead to constructions that confuse us about what's really going on</p> <p>and which way <code>\u304f\u305b\u306b</code> is pointing.</p> <p>So, for example, <code>\u7537\u306e\u304f\u305b\u306b\u6ce3\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3088</code>.</p> <p>Now what's going on here?</p> <p><code>Despite the fact that you're a man, stop crying</code>?</p> <p></p> <p>Is that what it's saying? Well, no, it isn't.</p> <p><code>\u7537\u306e\u304f\u305b\u306b</code> is being used in a trailing manner like the previous example.</p> <p>And then <code>\u6ce3\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3088</code> is being added to that trailing insult,</p> <p>as it were, and that's a command.</p> <p>I've done a video on commands. (Lesson 83)</p> <p>So, <code>\u6ce3\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3088</code> is not a sentence, it's just a command: <code>Stop crying!</code></p> <p>Just as in English <code>Stop crying</code> is not a sentence with a subject and a predicate.</p> <p>It's just a command.</p> <p>So really those two statements</p> <p>should be separated by a period (or in Japanese a <code>\u307e\u308b / \u3002</code>)</p> <p>because they're not part of the same sentence,</p> <p>but they won't necessarily be when you see them written</p> <p>and they won't necessarily have a wide gap when you hear them spoken.</p> <p><code>\u7537\u306e\u304f\u305b\u306b\u6ce3\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3088</code>:</p> <p>these are two separate statements</p> <p>and if we don't understand that</p> <p>it can confuse us about the use of <code>\u304f\u305b\u306b</code>.</p> <p>Another thing that can be confusing is that</p> <p>the connection may go the other way around.</p> <p>Generally speaking, we take the qualities of a person,</p> <p>which are fundamentally good qualities</p> <p>-- being a man, being a girl, being rich --</p> <p>and then adding something negative to it:</p> <p>Despite the fact that you're a girl, the room's a mess /</p> <p>Despite the fact that you're a man, you're hiding in the corner /</p> <p>Despite the fact that you're rich, you're stingy.</p> <p>But it can go the other way around too.</p> <p>For example, we might say</p> <p><code>\u4e0b\u624b\u306a\u304f\u305b\u306b\u71b1\u5fc3\u3060</code>.</p> <p>This means <code>despite the fact that he's unskilful / useless, he's enthusiastic</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, this generally isn't used in a positive sense.</p> <p>It's meaning: \"Here's this person going around being all enthusiastic, and he's useless, he can't do anything\u2019.</p> <p>So it can also work that way around and we need to be aware of that,</p> <p>because that again can fool us.</p> <p>Most of the time the contrastive conjunction</p> <p>goes the way around we've been talking about,</p> <p>but it doesn't have to.</p> <p>Now, if this was a textbook or a JLPT instruction</p> <p>we would talk about what they call the <code>\u63a5\u7d9a</code> (the conjunctions): ::: info \u63a5\u7d9a is an abbreviation that can be used for the term conjunction, full version is \u63a5\u7d9a\u8a9e ::: how does <code>\u304f\u305b\u306b</code> attach to what comes before it?</p> <p></p> <p>We know how it attaches to what comes after it:</p> <p>it's simply a clause connector</p> <p>so what comes after it is the second clause, which could be left off.</p> <p>But what the standard texts will talk about is how it connects to what comes before it:</p> <p>with a noun you use \u306e,</p> <p>with an adjectival noun you use -\u306a,</p> <p>with an adjective you don't use anything.</p> <p>None of this, of course, is necessary if you've done structural Japanese.</p> <p><code>\u304f\u305b</code>, whatever it is, whatever its etymology, is a noun.</p> <p>We pretty much know that, because</p> <p>anything that isn't a verb or an adjective is a noun in Japanese.</p> <p></p> <p>What comes before <code>\u304f\u305b</code> is modifying <code>\u304f\u305b</code>,</p> <p>it's telling us what kind of <code>\u304f\u305b</code> we're talking about.</p> <p>And it does that in exactly the same way that every modifier always modifies a noun.</p> <p></p> <p>So, if it's a noun, which it most often is,</p> <p>then we use \u306e for modifying the other noun</p> <p>that's following it just as we always do:</p> <p><code>\u7537\u306e\u304f\u305b / \u5973\u306e\u304f\u305b\u306b</code>.</p> <p>If it happens to be an adjectival noun,</p> <p>then obviously we use -\u306a as we did with <code>\u4e0b\u624b\u306a\u304f\u305b\u306b</code>.</p> <p>And if it's an adjective obviously we don't need anything else</p> <p>-- adjectives modify nouns directly.</p> <p>That's what an adjective does.</p> <p>So we might say <code>\u82e5\u3044\u304f\u305b\u306b\u304a\u5e74\u5bc4\u308a\u306b\u5e2d\u3092\u8b72\u3089\u306a\u3044</code></p> <p>(even though she's young, she doesn't give up her seat to older people).</p> <p>If it were a verb, obviously we'd just use the verb to modify the noun as we always do.</p> <p></p> <p>So I think now that you won't have any problems with <code>\u304f\u305b\u306b</code>.</p> <p>If you have any problems or questions, about that or anything else,</p> <p>please put them in the Comments below and I will answer as usual.</p> <p>I'd like to thank my Gold Kokeshi patrons, my producer-angels,</p> <p>who make these videos possible, and all my patrons and supporters.</p> <p>One of the things that our revolution in Japanese is doing is</p> <p>not just showing us techniques to apply but showing us that we need to apply them flexibly.</p> <p>Some techniques apply sometimes and not other times.</p> <p>History and etymology of words can be very useful on occasion,</p> <p>and I've done videos about that.</p> <p>And whenever I do a video about that,</p> <p>even if I point out that history and etymology are not always very useful,</p> <p>people start asking me,</p> <p><code>Do you know the history of this, do you know the history of that?</code></p> <p>And well, of course I can just look it up in most cases.</p> <p>You can't always find it in English</p> <p>but you can usually find it in Japanese.</p> <p>But the point is that there are occasions</p> <p>where the etymology helps us enormously,</p> <p>there are occasions where it doesn't help us at all,</p> <p>there are occasions where it could help us somewhat</p> <p>but it's a rather roundabout route</p> <p>and we can shortcut it by learning things by another method.</p> <p>Part of our revolution here</p> <p>is getting away from the rigid approach of textbooks.</p> <p>But always applying the fundamental structural knowledge,</p> <p>because structural knowledge gives us the core we need</p> <p>to get us away from rote learning of this and rote learning of that.</p> <p>Thank you all for your help in this revolution.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/94-%E3%81%8F%E3%82%89%E3%81%84-vs-%E3%81%BB%E3%81%A9/","title":"94. \u304f\u3089\u3044 VS \u307b\u3069","text":"<p>\u304f\u3089\u3044 (kurai) VS \u307b\u3069

<p>because I deal with the Japanese language structurally and people sometimes ask,</p> <p>\"Does it help in understanding the granular structure of the language</p> <p>to know something about its history, to know where words come from?\"</p> <p></p> <p>And my answer to that is a pragmatic one, because my whole approach is pragmatic,</p> <p>and the answer is, <code>I would say most of the time no, but some of the time yes.</code></p> <p>I'm assuming that most people watching these videos want</p> <p>to learn to use Japanese, read it, hear it, speak it, write it,</p> <p>and are not fundamentally interested in the history of the language.</p> <p>If we are interested in the history of the language, that's a different matter.</p> <p>purely from the perspective of acquiring the language,</p> <p>it's cluttering our minds with information we don't particularly need.</p> <p>But there are times when it becomes very useful to know</p> <p>something about the history of the language and times</p> <p>when structural puzzles can't be completely solved without it.</p> <p>And I'll try to give you a heads up where that's the case</p> <p>and give you the necessary information.</p> <p>There are also times, which may seem strange,</p> <p>when not so much the actual history of the language but folk history,</p> <p>etymological ideas that aren't actually correct, can be very useful.</p> <p></p> <p>That sounds strange, I know, but why is it?</p> <p>Well, it's because one of the things about the history of the language</p> <p>and why it often isn't very useful is that</p> <p>it's not telling us about how the language works now,</p> <p>it's telling us about how the language used to work a few hundred years ago.</p> <p>And we don't particularly need to know

this is an interesting question, and it's not that critical an issue</p> <p>when we're talking about the more usual meanings of <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code>,</p> <p>when it means <code>thank you</code> or something like that.</p> <p>It does become more of a critical issue when we look at another meaning</p> <p>that it has which seems to be quite unrelated but actually isn't.</p> <p>When we look in a dictionary, we find a lot of definitions for <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code>:</p> <p>thank you, thanks, much, very, and also things like somehow, in spite of oneself,</p> <p>try as one might, no matter how one may try to do or not to do.</p> <p></p> <p>And as you see they seem to be quite unrelated to the more common meanings of the word</p> <p>and it helps us a good deal to know where <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code> actually came from.</p> <p>One of the reasons I quoted Algirion-san's comment is that</p> <p>he actually got the structure right.</p> <p><code>I imagine the literal meaning is along the lines of 'in any way'.</code></p> <p>And it is.</p> <p>The trouble here is that unless we know a little more about the history</p> <p>that doesn't take us far enough.</p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code> actually begins in the Edo era</p> <p>and it's a contraction of the expression <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u8a00\u3048\u306c</code>.</p> <p>And that means <code>in any way</code> -- the <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code> part means <code>in any way</code> --</p> <p>and <code>\u8a00\u3048\u306c</code> means <code>unable to say</code>.</p> <p>That negativizing -\u306c is something I've talked about in a recent video,</p> <p>so if you don't know about that, I'll put a link above my head.</p> <p></p> <p>And in most of the more common uses this was used</p> <p>in the Edo period along with the word <code>\u307b\u3069</code>.</p> <p>And I've made a recent video about <code>\u307b\u3069</code> as well, so I'll link that. (Lesson 94)</p> <p>So, <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u8a00\u3048\u306c\u307b\u3069</code>:</p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u8a00\u3048\u306c</code> means <code>I'm not able in any way to say</code>;</p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u8a00\u3048\u306c\u307b\u3069</code> means <code>to the extent that I'm not able in any way to say</code>.</p> <p>And now we start to see how this applied to the commonest uses of <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059</code> means not just <code>Thank you</code> but</p> <p><code>I'm thankful to a degree (\u307b\u3069) that I am unable in any means to express / I'm inexpressibly grateful</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093</code>: <code>I'm inexpressibly sorry</code>.</p> <p>Now of course this is a hyperbole and, as always happens with hyperboles</p> <p>when they become settled into the language as regular expressions,</p> <p>it loses a lot of its force, so it ends up just meaning <code>very</code>.</p> <p>So, <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093</code> (I'm very sorry);</p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059</code> (Thank you very much).</p> <p>And this gets attached to basic set expressions like \u6328\u62f6</p> <p>to the point where it can be used to replace the \u6328\u62f6</p> <p>even in cases where it wouldn't be clear what the \u6328\u62f6 is.</p> <p>So we can use <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code> to replace goodbye and hello \u6328\u62f6.</p> <p>We're just saying <code>very much</code>: <code>I'm very happy to be seeing you</code>;</p> <p><code>I'm very much looking forward to meeting again</code>.</p> <p>It's just become a kind of general \u6328\u62f6 stand-in.</p> <p>And it's a very useful one because being somewhat effusive,</p> <p>it seems pleasant and polite, it's not over-formal, it's not over-informal,</p> <p>it's just a very useful expression to throw in in place of an \u6328\u62f6.</p> <p>Of course, it replaces the ones where it makes more logical sense,</p> <p>so we can say <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code> for <code>I'm sorry</code>, and <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code> for <code>thank you</code>.</p> <p>So these are the commoner uses.</p> <p>Now, the other meanings in the dictionary: somehow, in spite of oneself,</p> <p>no matter how hard one might try to or try not to -- that kind of thing.</p> <p>We can see that this is in fact <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u8a00\u3048\u306c</code> without the <code>\u307b\u3069</code>.</p> <p>We're just saying <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u8a00\u3048\u306c</code> (I can't by any means express).</p> <p>So if we say <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u843d\u3061\u4ed8\u304b\u306a\u3044</code></p> <p>(somehow I just can't calm down, can't settle down).</p> <p></p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code> (somehow), which is originally <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u8a00\u3048\u306c</code>:</p> <p>I can't in any way say why, but I can't settle down.</p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u547c\u5438\u304c\u5408\u308f\u306a\u3044</code> (somehow we just don't get on).</p> <p><code>Our breaths don't come together</code>, literally.</p> <p></p> <p>Somehow we just don't get on --</p> <p>I can't possibly say why that is, but somehow that's the case.</p> <p>And from there on, if we can't do something or we don't end up doing something,</p> <p>and no matter how hard we try to do it or not do it, it doesn't come about...</p> <p><code>\u3069\u3046\u3082\u8a00\u3048\u306c</code> (I can't say why, but that's just how it is).</p> <p>So this is how \"\u3069\u3046\u3082' comes to have such a wide range of meanings.</p> <p>And if we link it back to just that concept</p> <p>of not in any way being able to express,</p> <p>we can see how it all came about,</p> <p>and I think it makes it much easier to understand and manage.</p>"},{"location":"cure-dolly/95-using-word-history-the-smart-way-%E3%81%A9%E3%81%86%E3%82%82-%E3%82%84%E3%81%A3%E3%81%B1%E3%82%8A-%E3%82%84%E3%81%AF%E3%82%8A/#_2","title":"\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a

<code>\u3084\u306f\u308a</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>It's rather like <code>\u65e5\u672c / \u306b\u307b\u3093</code>, which also can be said as <code>\u306b\u3063\u307d\u3093</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3084\u306f\u308a</code> can be said as <code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a</code>.</p> <p>And the most usual way in which we hear this is meaning</p> <p><code>just as we thought, just as we understood</code>.</p> <p>So, if Sakura does something very silly, we might say,</p> <p><code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306f\u30d0\u30ab\u306a\u306e\u306d</code> (Just as we thought, Sakura's an idiot).</p> <p></p> <p>Now, another way we often hear it in immersion, anime, other places,</p> <p>is when a feeling wells up inside us and very often changes our mind.</p> <p>So, for example, if our heroine looks at a scary house</p> <p>and she says, <code>Ooh, that's really scary, I'm not going in there</code></p> <p>and then she makes up her mind, steels her nerve, and says,</p> <p><code>Right, I'm going in</code> (\u3088\u3057\u884c\u304f\u305e) and in she marches, she opens the door,</p> <p>looks around and says <code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u6016\u3044</code> (As expected, (it) scary-is) and decides not to go in after all.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, what's going on here?</p> <p>The dictionary once again gives it quite a wide range of meanings, some of which</p> <p>we hear less often but all of which are part of the meaning of the word, like</p> <p>still, as before, even so, either way, nonetheless, etcetera.</p> <p></p> <p>How does all this fit into <code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a</code>?</p> <p>Now, there is a folk etymology for <code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a</code>.</p> <p><code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a</code> is written in kanji like this. (or rather \u3084\u306f\u308a since it won\u2019t give you the option with \u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a)</p> <p></p> <p>Don't write it like this because you'll look like someone who's done Heisig</p> <p>and has no idea what's written in kanji and what isn't.</p> <p>Note; This is good advice indeed, since one of the things of Japanese is knowing when an expression has an outdated/unnecessary Kanji form that is no longer really used outside of some specific writings in general language. Usually speaking, at least via Japanese keyboard, what is suggested to you first is likely the most common version; common expressions and function words tend not to use Kanji and writing every single word in Kanji may seem excessive. You will get the hang of what words do not tend to use their Kanji forms the more you read.</p> <p>Though, some authors may use outdated/excessive Kanji forms to simulate archaic settings etc.</p> <p>But these are the kanji: <code>\u3084\u306f\u308a</code>.</p> <p>As you see, we have an arrow</p> <p>and we have the kanji for stretching or straining or tightening.</p> <p>And these kanji aren't in fact the original kanji</p> <p>and were apparently only used for the sound.</p> <p>So the folk etymology here isn't historically accurate.</p> <p>But what it states is that the kanji, which are for pulling an arrow tight on a bow --</p> <p>what happens when we pull an arrow tight on a bow?</p> <p>Well, at this point we're focusing, aren't we, on the target.</p> <p>And in Zen archery -- and Japanese archery is rather based in Zen --</p> <p>we're supposed to see nothing but that target.</p> <p>Now, suppose we are distracted.</p> <p>Suppose we look around, see something,</p> <p>hear something rustling, somebody speaks to us.</p> <p>If we're good archers, immediately after that we go back to the <code>\u3084\u306f\u308a</code>,</p> <p>the stretched-bow target beyond which we see nothing else.</p> <p>So, the idea is returning to our original focus.</p> <p>This is what we mean when we're talking about Sakura.</p> <p>We always thought she was an idiot , and <code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a</code> she is an idiot.</p> <p>It also works with feelings, which are a stronger focus in a way than thoughts.</p> <p>So, if something felt scary in the first place, then we decide to go and face it,</p> <p>and then when we get there, <code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a</code> it is scary,</p> <p>we're pulled back to our original focus.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, what we do about this depends on us.</p> <p>We may then decide not to go in; we may decide to go in.</p> <p>But either way, we've been pulled back to that <code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a</code>, that original focus.</p> <p>So what about these other dictionary definitions?</p> <p></p> <p>As is often the case with English dictionary definitions,</p> <p>these aren't really things that <code>\u3084\u306f\u308a / \u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a</code> actually means</p> <p>so much as English expressions whose meaning spectrum</p> <p>overlaps with that of <code>\u3084\u306f\u308a</code> at certain points.</p> <p>So, when we take the words <code>either</code> and <code>also</code>,</p> <p>which actually mean the same thing in certain contexts in English...</p> <p>It's just that English uses one word for the negative</p> <p>and another for the positive, which Japanese doesn't.</p> <p>So, for example, if we say <code>\u3084\u306f\u308a...</code> (and in cases like this it is usually <code>\u3084\u306f\u308a</code>)</p> <p><code>\u3084\u306f\u308a\u50d5\u3082\u898b\u306a\u3044</code> (I don't see it either).</p> <p></p> <p>What's that <code>\u3084\u306f\u308a</code> doing there?</p> <p>Well, of course we don't say <code>I didn't see it either</code> unless</p> <p>the other person has said they didn't see it.</p> <p>So what we're doing here is returning to the original focus</p> <p>of the conversation:</p> <p>A: \"You didn't see it?</p> <p>B: Well.. (stressing the point by saying that we're returning back to that focus) I didn't see it either.\"</p> <p><code>\u50d5\u3082\u3084\u306f\u308a\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f</code> (I went too / I also went).</p> <p>Again, the other person has said that they went</p> <p>and we stress the \u3082 by saying <code>\u3084\u306f\u308a</code>,</p> <p>returning to the original focus of this part of the conversation,</p> <p>to the fact that you went, <code>well, *\u3084\u306f\u308a -- original focus -- I went too*.</code></p> <p>And it can be used for concepts beyond even what the dictionaries draw it out to.</p> <p>For example, it can mean <code>predictably</code>:</p> <p><code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u96e8\u304c\u964d\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f.</code></p> <p></p> <p>Now, in this case we may not have been specifically thinking it was going to rain,</p> <p>but what we're saying is well, everyone knows it rains on these occasions.</p> <p>So, going back to what might have been our original focus, if we'd had one,</p> <p><code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u96e8\u304c\u964d\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f</code> or as you might say in English,</p> <p><code>Just as you might have expected, it rained</code>.</p> <p>So I hope that helps with these very common words.</p> <p>And fortunately I would say it's not that often</p> <p>that we need to know historical information outside of</p> <p>the ordinary structure of a word in order to understand it.</p> <p>But obviously there are cases,</p> <p>especially with expressions drawn from proverbs and things like that,</p> <p>where it helps to know the proverb,</p> <p>and in some cases with actual words like this</p> <p>where it helps to know what <code>\u3069\u3046\u3082</code> originally meant.</p> <p>And in the case of <code>\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a</code>, it's a concept that we don't really have in English,</p> <p>this original-focus concept, and even though it's a folk etymology,</p> <p>not a historical etymology, it really helps us to understand</p> <p>how Japanese people see and understand that expression.</p> <p>::: info As always, you can check the comments of the video for some interesting bits.
